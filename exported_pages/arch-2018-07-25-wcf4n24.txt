Cindy
	* GPII-3213: support settings with memory
		* Completed
		* Astea team is integrating this work and has problem with receiving updated settings for captions and dictionary. Looking into this issue
	* GPII-3193: when no actual key is keyed in, key in the special reserved "noUser" key so that QSS is still operable when no user is keyed in
		* Antranig and I had a couple of round of discussions. In progress
	* Meetings on account managment and snapset loading

JJ
	* Updating all my open pull requests.
	* Finishing up GPII-3145, last final big pull for first wave.
	* Meet with non-technical onboarding team, talk about the new onboarding sheets for settings.
		* Started working with Steve into small spec for the way we represent settings in the sheets.
	* Some work in GPII-1053.

Joseph:
	* Most of my time spent working on scripts for GPII-3138: Update snapsets in data base.
		* modifying both the bash script in gpii-dataloader and a new node script in universal
		* close to finished; need to test docker images and then in the cloud
		* met with Cindy and Tyler
			* one conclusion is that we could get rid of gpii-dataloader since most of the work is done in universal
			* but likley not do-able for the Aug release
			* stay with status quo for now, and revisit after Aug release
	* New fedora27 vagrant box for universal
		* met with Gio re: lack of mouse interaction in the current box
		* likely due to wrong guest addtions, version of VirtualBox and issue with Linux kernel or some combination thereof
		* Gio made a new box and it works.
			* VirtualBox v5.2.16
			* inclusivedesign/fedora27 v20180723
