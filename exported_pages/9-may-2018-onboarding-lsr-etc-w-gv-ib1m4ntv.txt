Question to Gregg: 
    What is comprised in "all settings" under point Stage 3 on document 2
    This is referenced in JIRA https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-1911

Gregg has assembled draft spreadsheet for onboarding schema skeleton:


Pass 1: We will only onboard settings that are "important and safe"

Phase 1: They will go into the application and make a list of things they see in the control panel, instruction manual, etc in documented and visible features of the application.
Contact the company and work their way to the "chief engineer" - this meeting we record so it can be used as technical reference.
Some settings may only be evident when a product is fired up in a context with a particular device.
Some settings may be "withdrawn" from public availability but still remain in persistence for backward compatibility purposes.
Some may also be discovered opportunistically by means of investigating persistence.

In light of this we don't expect hard and fast rules for determining the exact boundary of all useful and safe settings of interest to AP.
