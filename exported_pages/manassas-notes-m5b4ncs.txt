The College Engineers - "people who work directly with Steve Sachs".
Next meeting - representative for engineering staff will be present.

DeepFreeze equivalent is "Centurion"

Student accessible computers are provisioned from an image based on software requests from faculty.
Image update period is irregular - might be as long as a semester.

Disk is wiped by Centurion each time computer is restarted.



For the students, there is no shared volume mapped to their account.
They use the Blackboard account as their repository. They also have an associated gmail.

Windows 10 only, contrary to what we were told at earlier stages.

Will we need to buy and set up Centurion to investigate / make use of images they provide us?
Seems likely - I can't find any docs on their image format

Internal infrastructure in the network seems good, compared to what we've been told. Doesn't sound like internal bandwidth will be a problem.
