The use of "nock" library: https://github.com/cindyli/universal/blob/GPII-2538/gpii/node_modules/accessRequester/test/AccessRequesterTests.js#L33

Nock: https://github.com/node-nock/nock

Other options:
	* sinon: http://sinonjs.org/
		* Doesn't work well with node.js tests
		* works great with browser tests
		* https://github.com/sinonjs/sinon/issues/174 - 
		* Justin's use of it in fluid-publish tests: https://github.com/fluid-project/fluid-publish/blob/master/tests/publishTests.js#L185
	* mock-socket: https://github.com/thoov/mock-socket
		* work with mocking up web sockets
		* doesn't work with http mockup

Requirements to consider at picking a node.js mock library:
	* be able to mock up http requests
	* be able to mock up web socket requests
	* be able to use for browser tests
	* support for redirects, where an initial request is replied to with a 301 status and the headers indicating the new location, and where a secondary request is presumed to be immediately conducted against the new location.

Next steps:
	* Write a technology evaluation to explore the strengths and weaknesses of various mockup libraries
	* Use nock in a more infusion way: 1. set it up at the start of the test sequence or the onCreate of the tested component; 2. tear it down at onDestroy of the tested component
