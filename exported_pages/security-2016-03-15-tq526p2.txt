Agenda

	* Review actions from last meeting
	* Simon and Michelle working on gathering requirements and planning
	* Component deployment configuration -- microservices in the cloud?

Actions from last meeting (9-Mar-2016):
		* Adewale to lead work on risk assessment framework
		* Simon to add link to Cindy's https://github.com/cindyli/gpii-payloads/ to the GPII wiki Security Dashboard page
		* Sandra to continue on documenting ATs targeted for American Job Centers (based on survey list from Maureen Kaine)
		* Alejandro to continue on preferences gathering looking towards what we will cover going into the future (5 years) - my work is getting updated here https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-1586
			* Working with Maureen to collect the most we can about the AJC center that we are going to pilot soon. <- This could be an interesting input for security reasons, maybe.
		* Adewale volunteered to create a draft of actionable items that need to be prioritized and planned for (schedule)

Risk Assessment Framework

Is is reasonable to describe GPII as microservices?

What do we mean by "microservices"?

	* standalone "app"
	* unique URL

GPII consists of parts, components, communicating through REST. GPII supports different deployment profiles. A Node.js instance may run one or more GPII components, depending on deployment configuration.

Adewale: we will need to come up with a framework for governing Node.js deployment security. Existing best practices or standards focus on "monolithic" applications rather than the loosely coupled systems like GPII.

Next steps:

	* Systems Security Plan -- documentation framework for system security
	* Diagram of end-to-end workflow detailing authentication

Viewing local system changes made by GPII

Rich: GPII changes the user's system when applying settings, such as changing registry values. Does IBM have tools to determine if another person is viewing those changes? QRadar

Use case: deployed in public places, other persons are accessing registry values to spy on user's preferences.

Actions

	* Send out GPII deployment diagrams, mapping of components to Node.js instances
	* Team (Michelle/Cindy/Simon) to work with Adewale on authentication workflow diagram
