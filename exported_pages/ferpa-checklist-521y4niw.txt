We have:
	* Inventory list
	* TFA
	* Layered defense
	* Secure configurations:
		* Security scans
		* Process of deploying changes, Pipelines, reviews
		* Inventory and alers based on it
		* Access control, minimal IAM permissions
	* Athentication between services
	* IDS implemented in the cloud security center
	* Automated vulnerability scaning
	* Patch management
	* Shut down unnecessary services
	* We don't have mobile devices
	* Emailing encrypted data, we use gpg or other service to send p2p data




We don't have or it's not completed:
	* Incident handling, we have documented a lot of things in our readmes, but this is not well structured.


Anyway we need to cover tasks left directly writed by Brendan which we can not map directly to the checklist , but it seems that they are requried to pass the FERPA auditory
