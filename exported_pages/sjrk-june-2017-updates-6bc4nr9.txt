Social Justice Repair Kit - Update 

In preparation for Jutta's update meeting with the Oak Foundation next week, we've pulled together some themes and links from the SJRK work so far...

Building the Community of Collaborators
Goal: to build a core group that can advance the work of ensuring youth with learning differences are not left out of social movements

The project resonates with people and we are learning from each other.

	* Slack: https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Social+Justice+Repair+Kit+-+Slack+Information
	* Mailing List: http://lists.idrc.ocadu.ca/mailman/listinfo/sojustrepairit

Group Meetings
		* Currently finding a time that works for all partners for a regularly scheduled check in time

One-Size-Fits-One Meetings
		* Our partners are very diverse and we need to co-design with them individually as well as collectively
		* Holding meetings with individual partners to flesh out work plans and budget

Storytelling

Goal: to explore the specific role of telling stories for youth movements and social justice; to find ways to make telling and hearing stories more inclusive, to use story creation as a learning tool in itself

We have found the storytelling theme resonates in our discussions, and we think it will result in concrete artifacts and tools.

Co-Design

Goal: to create and revise resources supporting youth and youth organisations in holding co-design sessions

We are applying co-design in multiple contexts - in our own work with the partners, and in the partners work within their wider networks.

Citizen Research

Goal: to provide tools and examples that support youth engaging in citizen research

We are exploring how to leverage and repurpose our existing work towards youth involvement in citizen research.
