GPII Architecture Meeting Minutes, August 21st, 2019

UPDATES:
Sandra:
    - Working on Morphic 1.2.1 candidate (JJ, Streve Grundell, Kavya, Antranig) which has fixes for wallpaper being reset at AJC3, and new issue found during installations at a library in Citrus, FL. New installer available this morning being tested. 
    - Updates to status for Gregg. 

Antranig:
	* Have been away and ill a bit
	* Meeting with HA to talk through updates
	* Interview of Chris, MacOS dev candidate - quite promising
	* Peripherally involved in looking at Citrus issue
	* Good meeting with JJ and stegru talking through oustanding Windows work and catching up with old priorities - 
		* Notes at https://pad.gpii.net/p/jjs-pull-status-67c4nr5?
	* Helping Justin debug a relay problem


Justin:
	* PR for FLUID-6394 which is needed for GPII-3767
		* https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/960#issuecomment-521271933
	* Many of the upcoming priorities are related to page level TTS or pause/resume of selected text TTS, however these are all affected by the Chrome pause bug.
		* https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3286
		* these priorities will be on hold as we await a fix to chrome
		* may investigate possibility of providing a fix to chrome
	* Working on
		* GPII-3322: Context Menu of preferences adjusters for on/off prefs
			* https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3322
		* GPII-2840: Reset method
			* https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2840
		* Investigating UIO+ model relay errors.
			* appears to happen when there are many iframes on a page. Content scripts are loaded into each and spawn more portBinding components that setup additional model relays.
			* setting fluid.relayRecursionBailout = 1000; will fix the issue. Is this an acceptable practice?
				* AB: Seems astonishing - we should put in some trace statements to try to understand what on earth could be happening. I can't imagine any reasonable series of relays that would converge after 1000 relays that hadn't converged after 100.

Kavya:
	* Testing done on early versions windows - more testing on newly onboarded features - expected to finish and send update by Fri
	* Created new MS VM and testing Morphic 1.2 - expected to finish and send update by Fri
	* Testing new  Morphic 1.2.1 released this morning with below fixes
		*  GPII-4087: AJC3 Wallpaper interaction with high-contrast fix
		* GPII-4092: QSS failing due to no sound card
		* Testing update: Issues fixed - continuing to do more testing today. A new Morphic 1.2.1 installer is expected soon from JJ with a fix for known issue..
