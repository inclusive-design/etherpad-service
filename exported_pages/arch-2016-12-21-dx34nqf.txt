Updates

Avtar:
	* Tested Gio's updated Vagrant boxes with GPII/linux and GPII/universal -- can get VMs provisioned and all tests pass. The nexus repo needs a PR so that the correct version of nodejs is installed, currently what is in the master branch will not result in a correctly provisioned VM.
	* Tested https://github.com/GPII/ci-service/pull/23 but could not get it to work as-is. Backslashes in paths need to be escaped.
	* Playing with the chartAuthoring multiline chart [0] to create a CI widget for the P4A meeting, was using test data before and now going to move forward with mock CI results [1] for all of Infusion's commits.

Tony
	1. Working on the UL Image API for the upcoming user review in January.  No major objections to my proposed technology choices, so I will proceed as outlined on the list.
	1. Still need input on scanning incoming file content, didn't see anything from the team.  Mentioning it here in case Gio, Avtar, et cetera have comments. https://www.rfxn.com/projects/linux-malware-detect/
	1. Started working with test sequences, discovered a problem with in npm/yarn when combining release versions with git hashed versions.  Basically an older githash with the upcoming release version can end up being resolved as the "root" version, even if it comes from a dependent project.  Best practice is to use fluid-publish and tagged versions rather than githashes.
	1. Out of the office on the 23rd, 26th, 27th, and 30th.

AGENDA:

	* Giovanni has been running latest VirtualBox 5.1.x and vagrant 1.9.x without issues (time to upgrade to VB 5.1?)
		* CI build node has been using that as well
		* Latest Fedora 24 and CentOS 7 vagrant boxes have already been built with VBox Guest Additions 5.1 (`vagrant box update` to fetch new ones)
		* Carefully suggesting people might want to upgrade
		* If you're on Windows / OSX, please apply these changes: https://github.com/GPII/linux/pull/89
