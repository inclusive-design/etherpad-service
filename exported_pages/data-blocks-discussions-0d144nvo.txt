Onboarding office ribbon: https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3448

Pull request comment from December 12th 2018 reflecting that we had decided on "suffix" strategy - https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/698#issuecomment-446689186

Installing gpii-assets - Gregg would like this to be resolved from the web.
Will we resolve this via github pages? Don't even need this, can resolve via github "raw" URLs.

Ribbons are a few K per ribbon
