Contents of packaged release:

	* Visible Nexus with Co-Occurrence Engine
		* Node.js web service
			* REST API for managing Infusion components
			* HTML UI
	* Command line tool to load configurations
		* https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2670
	* Demos?

Desirable qualities:

	* Nexus running in sandboxed/isolated environment
	* Just download and run
		* No need to npm install
		* Minimal dependencies
	* Cross-platform (Windows, Mac, Linux)

Nexus executable options:

	* Vagrant configuration
		* Alan created for Visible Nexus
			* https://github.com/amb26/fluid-authoring/compare/FLUID-4884...simonbates:GPII-2305
		* Benefit to making custom Vagrant Box?
	* VirtualBox image
	* Docker image (good for Linux, not so great for Windows and Mac?)
		* On Windows and Mac, runs Linux VM to host containers -- is this true?
		* https://www.docker.com/docker-windows
		* https://www.docker.com/docker-mac
		* https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/deploy-containers/linux-containers
		* https://www.hanselman.com/blog/DockerAndLinuxContainersOnWindowsWithOrWithoutHyperVVirtualMachines.aspx
	* Electron App (no isolation?)
	* Windows APPX (Windows only)
	* Linux RPM or DEB packages with SELinux for isolation

Cannot run VirtualBox and either Docker for Windows or Docker for Mac at the same time:

	* Hyper-V
	* Xhive
	* It's possible to run on the same machine, but need to restart between

Distribution options:

	* A GitHub project called nexus-dist that contains packaged artifacts

Questions:

	* What's the best packaging format?
	* If it's something that is built, how to orchestrate the build?
	* How to distribute the packaged version?

Proposal:

	* Docker image running Nexus
	* Vagrantfile:
		* Minimal headless Linux image with Docker (we maintain this already: inclusivedesign-centos image)
		* Runs Nexus Docker image at boot
		* Makes Nexus network port 9081 (port for REST and UI) available to virtual machine, and on to host machine

TODOs:

	* Simon to send Gio instructions to run Visible Nexus
		* https://github.com/amb26/fluid-authoring/tree/FLUID-4884
		* https://github.com/amb26/fluid-authoring/tree/FLUID-4884#remote-demo-based-on-bare-gpii-nexus
		* npm install
		* node visibleNexus.js
		* http://localhost:9081/visible-nexus/visibleNexus.html 
	* Simon to finish Co-Occurrence integration
