Participants: Greg, Sandra, Bern, Cindy, Colin, Whitney

Goals: 
1. Discuss the workflow to request and manage client credentials: https://wiki.gpii.net/w/Workflows_to_Request_and_Manage_Client_Credentials
2. Possibility to automate this workflow: the decision is to use option 3 on the wiki, which automates most things

Q: do we need "GPII manager"
A: Greg said: we can make the assumption that the computer must have internet connection (connection to GPII Cloud) at the installation time. The request of client credentials must happen at the installation. This will make the GPII manager interface for requesting client credentials go away. We will still need the message such as "you are not connected to the internet".

Q: If computer is connected to the intenet at install -- does it make the need for GPII Manager interaction with the user go away? 

If the client credential is revoked somehow and the gpii application stops working, there must be ways such as reinstalling or repair the installation to request a new client credential and get things back to work.
