Tony:
    
	1. Continuing to work on UL imports, this week on monitoring for outdated content. 
	1. Still working on the universal "code coverage" pull:  https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/508
		2. There were some oddities in running the new universal browser tests in Windows that were resolved earlier this week (down to the output of fluid.module.resolvePath not matching the output of process.cwd on Windows closely enough for Testem's tastes).
		2. As agreed last week, now that the tests pass in individual environments, the universal CI configuration has been updated.  Tests pass, as far as I can see we're ready to merge. 
		2. All open pulls that have not already brought in my changes will now appear to have failing builds.  Happy to help anyone who needs to update their pull if there are issues, just reach out. 
	1. Per feedback from early adopter Steve Githens, working on dynamic reloading of templates in gpii-handlebars: https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2474
	1. Continued to test Avtar's excellent work with Docker, GitLab, and Vagrant.
	1. Moving to a new collocation space on Monday (WeWork).  You should come visit.


Tyler:
    Finished GPII-2443: automated configuration of CI build node
    Starting on GPII-2412: terraform/kubernetes integration


AGENDA:

Onboarding flow (Ale Draft)
	* What does the onboarder need to provide with the solution?
	* What's the review process like?
	* How do we get test versions of the software getting onboarded?
	* How do we go about periodical testing?
	* What can we do to help support automated testing? (e.g. some kind of "mega AT" virtual machine that contains every application that we support)
		* how would we manage licenses for this? would we need some kind of special CI-only process and buy licenses just for that VM, or could developers use this VM on their computers?
	* WE SHOULD CREATE A WORK GROUP FOR THIS INSTEAD -- ALE WILL TAKE CARE OF CREATING THIS GROUP!

Next steps for multi-server CI environment setups ==> Gio started to work on this (GPII-2470)
	* Our currently failing "canary in the mine" pull request https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/510
		* Giovanni comment: https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/510#issuecomment-310130663
	* GPII-2411, GPII-2103, and more
	* Background information on why this is stuck:
		* Kasper's PR depends on a new preference set (mike|Vargas) that doesn't exist in the master branch
		* The tests depend on external services (preferences.gpii.net) and they are spin up from the master branch
		* We need better end-to-end tests that spin up an environment and point the tests to the right location (in other words, the tests need to run against an instance of Preferences server that was conjured from the same branch)
		* Another issues is that some tests are hard-coded to point to 'localhost' and that created a conflict with a separate Preferences server we wanted to spin up locally (see gist below)
		* This last issue (hardcoded localhost) could in theory be solved with the new work merged into fluid-project/kettle/pull/33 and modification to the GPII config files
		* Work done on the F2F to get this running (and then we got stuck with the hardcoded localhost tests) https://gist.github.com/gtirloni/eb38a8a031efea5e610ff12d31f52c0b
	* GIO IS WORKING ON THIS AND WILL BRING THIS UP AT A FUTURE MEETING IF NECESSARY

Device Reporter information for model transformation
How do we make the (available) screenresolution(s) (and other device reporter information) available to the model transformation of the settingshandlers? https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-1939
The Nuclear Deterrent - WHOM does it deter?
If the user asks for, say, "high" screen resolution, what do we imagine they will think they are asking for?
Simon has noted that high screen resolution may not necessarily correspond to having more things visible on the screen.
Isn't this in fact the job of the matchmaker?
Or indeed, more precisely, the job of the effectology - the user may be more interested in "how big things on the screen look to me", which is actually an EFFECT, compound of numerous other settings in the system, such as screen scaling, font scaling, etc.

We agreed that this is indeed the job of the effectology as described above. Since the matchmaker _does_ have access to the device reporter information, this is a non-issue. We just need to make sure that the available screen resolutions is reported as part of the device reporter payload.
