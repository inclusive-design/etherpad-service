4. Backup test
- started 18:16 :)
To get the latests snapshots:
for i in `seq 0 2`; do gcloud compute snapshots list --sort-by=~creationTimestamp,STATUS --limit=1 --format="value[separator=';'](name,status)" --filter="name~'pv-database-storage-couchdb-couchdb-$i-*'" | cut -f1 -d\; ; done
- unable to parse secrets ERROR
  - grant_project_admin step missing
- no replicas listed when running command in step 3.
- when creating disk - the disk had different name (copy/paster error)
- Step 9 - failure with one of the couchDb instances
  - did work after Kube doing 2 restarts
- [Alfredo]: Add a check to check membership in the cluster
- Uptime check recovered 18:42
- Done 18:48 -> took 32m
- Add a step to announce in #ops ?
- Add a line to env description

Q:
- as this means downtime on staging, should we mention/notify somewhere?

* Alfredo took an AI to communicate this / update rest of the team / update README
