		* service used by Linux DeviceReporter

	* - GPII-2404, GPII-1939 Changes to Windows DisplaySettingsManager, DeviceReporter (PlatformReporter) to report avialable screen resolutions

		* https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle/pull/42#discussion_r193029633
		* Data point:  fresh clean install of gpii-windows, followed by normal vagrant provisioning and npm install.  Then package-lock.json has changed.  What to do about this?
