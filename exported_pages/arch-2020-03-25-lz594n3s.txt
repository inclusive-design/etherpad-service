Steven Githens
    - Added a couple more dataType fixes to GPII-4340
    - Built yet another Morphic Capture installer fixing the reported issues from last
    - Wrote some command line scripts to test fetching access_token's and then all your settings from the cloud, to verify the capture stuff
    - Writing up detailed protocol for us to remotely install, run, and wrap up capture case studies
    - Added some widget to the capture page 4 to allow keying in there by pasting in a key token (rather than having to use USB or folder etc, since these are happening on folks home machines), working on this workflow with Bern


Steve Grundell:
    - Released 1.3.4
    - MYOB launchers now activate the running instance of an application, rather than starting a new one
    - Looking into the high contrast thing at login (if it wasn't reset at logout)
