Agenda:
    - Reqs from Richmond library pilot (early draft, we haven't received the formal specs doc)
	     - AWS is the backup in case GCP is not ready.  
		- Sandra needs to check on the status of the dataloader from Joseph. 
		- Checkpoint about go-nogo with GCP in next week's team meeting
		- Even if staying on AWS, there's work that Javi needs to do to move code to master branch
		
    - Confirming schedule for FERPA-compliant
	    - Nov 2nd will be the date to be FERPA compliant. 
	
    - SSP (-Lite?)
       - Let's start writing up our security procedures/etc
       - Team agrees to follow established workflow (write docs / README sections / etc as needed, avoid spending effort on more formal documentation)
    - All the items left in the parking lot of the stand up



Testing discussion started here: https://pad.gpii.net/mypads/?/mypads/group/gpii-infrastructure-meetings-iqt4nbr/pad/view/2018-08-27-j9h4n0j
* Sergey is close to merging Locust-based smoke tests -- POSTPONED UNTIL THIS HAPPENS. Sergey's PR (https://github.com/gpii-ops/gpii-infra/pull/93) collects data that informs this discussion.
* There's lots of high-level stuff to discuss but unclear when to do this, what it will impact

GPII-3250 - Prewarming indices?
* Yes, let's do something to make this work better
* dataloader might be a good place to do it

GPII-2865 - Testing Approach/Calico Network Policies
- +1 for Calico
  - Network security policies can be applied on a Pod level
- Not sure about testing. Try to implement the simplest tests.
- RSpec is too low level? Maybe serverspec? goss? (https://github.com/aelsabbahy/goss)
- There are questions re: to integrating the automated testing framework with terraform code
- Need another ticket for instance level security

What next? (Stepan)

Logging (formerly GPII-2954) next steps?
* https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3324 GPII-3235 GPII-3236 GPII-3237

Monitoring with Stackdriver Beta Kubernetes (or without it) (Sergey) -- MOVE TO OPS WEEKLY. Sergey is preparing a summary/mini-presentation about what he's learned so far and our options
