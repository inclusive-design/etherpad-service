Tyler:
* GPII-2412: Integrating Terraform and Kubernetes

Agenda:

Where to put freeTransforms used in the solution registry transformations?
	* When talking about onboarding the Chrome Extension, the topic
	* Example free transform function 
		* function: https://github.com/jobara/gpii-chrome-extension/blob/GPII-2466/extension/src/lib/chromeSettings.js#L180-L182 
		* transformation https://github.com/jobara/gpii-chrome-extension/blob/GPII-2466/extension/src/lib/chromeSettings.js#L144-L158
		* In the above case, in theory it should be easier to write it as a nested transformation in the solutions registry, as there are extra requirements/issues when writring transforms in modelRelays.
