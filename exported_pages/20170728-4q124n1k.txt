Inclusive Design Thinking

A Perspective Shift

What is Inclusive Design:
	Design that is not intrusive, usable for all people; everyone and everything.
	Design thinking.
	
	Disability: lack of ability.
	To meet the needs of an individual.
	
	Everyone experiences mismatch; inclusive design can solve mismatch; people of all abilities
	
	Starts with empathy
	
	Dan Formosa, Smart Design, "Objectified"
	
	The people in the middle don't have extreme needs; who's it failing for, or who's succeeding with it really well -- what's the difference, what's the gap.
	
	Magic at the Margins:
	- innovation
	- benefits the majority
	- supports the spectrum
	- resiliency
	
	Design Ideas:
	- with this brilliant or exclusionary idea -- who just got excluded
	- What can I do to bridge the gap I just created to avoid mismatch or solve it
