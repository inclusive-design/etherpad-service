Build Site

Goals: 
	1. Show current status of work in master branches
	1. Internal team work
	1. Testing
	1. Funding agencies
	1. End Users
	1. Reports
	1. Demos, based on latest development code, i.e. master branch in github repository.

Issues/Assumptions:
	1. These links are not stable
	1. The demos are not stable
		2. some demos are deleted as time goes by
	1. We might be trying to do too much with this page

Similar sites:
	1. Showcase on the IDRC site
	1. Featured work on the fluidproject site
	1. Archive of work - in the IDRC site redesign - not just demos, archive of all work
    


Suggestions:

An Archive that links out to demos 
- timeline of all work on IDRC site


What we use the build site for:
	1. Check if something is failing on a particular browser.
	1. Check if something is broken in master or in working branch
	1. Send to external people as an example of our work
	1. To see what has been done in the past
	1. Release testing
	1. To show people who come by on tours
	1. To see the latest work - review it and talk to the developers

Missing from the current build site:
	1. Infusion examples
	1. Descriptions of the demos - especially for the prefs framework
Note: we have descriptions in the overview panel on most of the demos
	1. Context
	1. Description of the site at the top - intended use
	1. Links to stable demos and where to find them
	1. Status
