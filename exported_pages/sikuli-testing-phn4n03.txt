Here are some notes to install and perform GPII testing using Sikuli:

Installation

	* Using Chocolatey ( https://chocolatey.org/packages/sikulix )
		* choco install -y sikulix

Running

	* Using commandline
		* C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\lib\sikulix\content\runsikulix.cmd -r C:\Users\vagrant\Desktop.sikuli
	* Running installer tests: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9VjMnTQ_Ec

Defining tests
	* Sample tests:
		* https://github.com/amatas/sikuli-gpii-test
	* Javi successfully created a simple test in javascript that starts the gpii (clicking on the icon) and stopping the gpii (through the tray icon)

Related issues, PRs and repositories:

	* https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-1992 - Evaluation
	* https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-1875 - Initial effort.
	* [Ale] : I remember there's some documents in drive. TODO: Look for them and add it here.

Actions:
	* How to integrate Sikuli into GPII.
		* Use cucumber?
		* Integration with node.js?
			* Cucumber (ruby) -> test definition (python) -> sikuli (java)
			* Explore the possibility to use jqUnit
		* IMHO the best way to integrate the tests and the thinking of the UX is using something like Cucumber
	* Create a set of basic testing examples to use them as a guideline.
	* Add as much tests we can using Sikuli for the HST release.
	* Integrate with the CI/CD platform
