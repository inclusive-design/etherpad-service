The data format used by gpii-express-user is comptible with the node module couchUser - as well as, presumably, the internal format used by CouchDB in its so-called "_users" table

What we need in gpii-express-user:
	* manage user in groups
	* user permissions
	* user profile
	* be able to work with oauth integration

2 levels of access:
	* OAuth privacy settings page: give permission to prefs or subset of prefs to be shared with services
	* PMT: to adminster all prefs and all tokens that are associated with a user

Difference btw kettle and gpii-express
kettle: has support to web sockets, used for infrastracture apps such as GPII and Nexus
gpii-express: support native express routing, target for user facing web apps that need handlebars and rendering, 

GPII requirements:
	* sign up, for preferences server and oauth server
