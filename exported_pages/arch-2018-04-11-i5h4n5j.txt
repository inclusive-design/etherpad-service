Simon:
	* Continuing code review of GPII-2630
		* https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/591
	* Attended meeting Friday with Cindy, Antranig, Colin, and Steve Githens on data modelling, capture tool, and preference editing integration

Tony:
	* Wrote an initial metaschema for FSL (Fluid Schema Lite) that we might use for "schema validated components", will review in the weekly meeting tomorrow.
	* Started initial sketches on the validator and components themselves, will add tests and continue to flesh those out as well.
	* Came up with an approach to electron code coverage that I have confirmed working in isolation.  Still having trouble getting it working with gpii-app, mainly because the tests never complete if I run them directly.  Have narrowed it down to the integration tests (thanks Georgi!), and further to three specific tests.  Could use some help from people more familiar with the gpii-app repo: https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/pull/44 - I can give a try to it :) Javi?
	* I looked over Joseph's universal process reporter bridge pull and left him some comments.  Someone else still needs to actually complete the review.
	* In that pull, the CI builds report various NullPointerException messages, just want to make sure this is expected: https://ci.gpii.net/job/universal-tests/812/console
		* I think that is a bug of the Jenkins plugin, but I'll check

Tyler:
    * Interviews
    * GCP migration, Exekube: https://github.com/exekube/exekube
