Summary:
    "We are building a curated learning experience for business, obligated organizations, community groups* on Inclusive Design."
    *for the exact wording of groups, see the Certified for Access project description.

What do we mean when we say we are making an "OER"?
* consolidation of content (like the Design Toolkit landing page)
* reframing
* better entry points - not buried in a thicket of the "Wiki garden"

What do we already have?
https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1xIhesOQroKDmyQQmBFf2f7uBssZmM4GO_Lu_Wirb95Y/edit?usp=sharing

Possible Entry Points:
    - document accessibility (ADOD), WCAG, ARIA
    - The ID Guide should be presented as a resource to be used - some thought may need to be given to re-present some parts 
    - Engagement: Concrete -> Perspective Shift. How might we strcuture / present / strategize to guide them along the path?
    - Tools section in the Guide may be the concrete things business audience are looking for immediately
	    - In the Tools section there's little going back to other parts - perhaps enhance this.

- ADOD:
	- mostly up to date: includes Word, Acrobat
	- the value is in its specificity. Keeping it up to date in important.
	- perhaps a redesign at some point.
	
Specifications / Standards
	- ARIA  -  https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aria/
		- should we make something like this?

Metadata - where does it fit overall? Do we want to make this more prevalent?

DIY bubble:
    - micro computers
	- prototyping tools
		- cardboard prototyping
		- upcoming sonification prototyping tool
		
Other resources to include:
	    - data visualization, sonification, dealing with big data

Questions:
	* Do we have any resources on dfinining "Customers"? (i.e. there may be no typical "customer" ... getting groups to think about their clients/customers/partners as a spectrum)
		* customer service - personalised options e.g. chat vs. phone
		* 
    * How do our partner projects fit into this? i.e. Pressbooks under DIY? Sapling Learning  as a case study?
    * How do we present the idea that going beyond the spec, standard, etc is good and encouraged?
	    * it may be implicit in some of our resources (i.e. Design Guide) but it may need to be more explicit.
	* How do we enable updating, adaptations, translations?
		* Are there tools already that can be used?
	How does this work with Razorfish?
		Razorfish will be making the Big Idea website
* Do we have a compiled list of examples of things like Good grips which are good examples of ID? Does one exist already?
	* http://www.accessiblesociety.org/topics/technology/eleccurbcut.htm
		
* Look to quantify the benefits of ID:
	Example:    http://www.martinprosperity.org/media/ReleasingConstraintsAccessible.html
	- David Lawson

What are we building:
    * a resource / compilation in some digital form which will then be incorporated somehow into the Big Ideas website (which Razorfish is making).
    * additional scaffolding and content required to flesh out obvious gaps.
    * Changes to improve access:
	* info re-architecture (i.e. for the ILDH?)
	* Redesign (i.e. for ADOD?)

	
1. "Smaller" resources that can be integrated into our existing resources
2. Stand-alone resources which need increased visibility e.g. re-design, or creation of doc site etc
3. Consolidate/describe our resources from BIGIDeAS perspective (redefine entry points etc)
	
Other resource:
    * presentations / slide decks / videos / other media?
    * concrete examples are awesome
	    i.e. web chat for customer service
	* case / success studies: Oxford Properties (they were at DEEP talking about how there were changing)
		*this would contribute to encouraging businesses to go beyond the standards etc
	* Resource / idea sharing:
		* how can this be done within groups: what tools are available? What are the benefits.

Do we have any Use Case Scenarios for our audience?
