AGENDA

From Steve Githens: Go over the server topography again, and which endpoints are open to who.

I believe that the preferences server is ultimately meant to be a private server behind our firewall, and then the Flowmanager or PPT must connect to it, while all outside traffic goes through one of them, or any other services we add.

The preferences server is still wide open on AWS, which is why I'm bringing it up, and wondering at what point we'll need to close it down to public access.
