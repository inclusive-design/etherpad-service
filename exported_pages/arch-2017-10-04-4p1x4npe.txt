Tony:

	1. Updated gpii-express with improved "global failure handler": https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2628
	1. Updated infusion-docs to use markdown-it instead of marked: https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6205
	1. As part of doing this, it was necessary to address https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5176 and check all links in the  docpad output.  Found ~150 broken links in various passes.  Around 100 are only broken when viewing the raw markdown on GitHub. 
	1. Of those, I fixed all but one, which is documented here: https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6207
	1. In discussions with Antranig on a minor gpii-json-schema pull, we discussed refactoring gpii.express.handler to use a prioritised chain of event listeners.  If any of that means anything to you, let me know, AFAIK I'm the only person who uses the grade: https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2632
