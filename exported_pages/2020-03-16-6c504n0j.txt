1. Anything to demo this week?
- nothing

2. Review key metrics - https://pad.gpii.net/mypads/?/mypads/group/gpii-infrastructure-standups-lix4njm/pad/view/key-metrics-for-infrastructure-pc1g4nnd
- 404s found in preferences metrics

3. CouchDB / DB future -> @Weekly
- staying with COuch for forseable future, but might move away
  - balance between keeping it alive and not investing too much time
- Scaling is not a priority (at all)

4. gpii-universal or gpii-app?
 - Universal broken for too long
   - Antranig might roll back universal, and start re-merging...
 - meeting tomorrow
 - gpii-app-test has been fixed after a long period of failures
 - probably nothing Ops team needs to worry about
 
5. Migrate the CI out of the IDRC
-> Alfredo is going to work on migrating Jenkins CI out of IDRC
  - meeting this week to discuss further with devs
  - consider moving away from Jenkins - Gitlab?
