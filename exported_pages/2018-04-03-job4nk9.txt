Agenda:
    - Tyler's presentation about cloud infrastructure status and accomplishments. Intended audience is Gregg. I plan to schedule a call with Gregg and the team later this week. 
    - Feedback on research by Tyler and Alfredo.
    - update on the status of "non-GPII" RTF sites? (adventures in containers on i26) AKA DON"T MODIFY CONTAINERS BY SHELLING INTO THEM AND STOP USING MY MAIL SERVERS!!!

Tyler:
* Manual user creation and tied it with Gcloud and IAM
- Recommends we continune down the path to move to GKE.
