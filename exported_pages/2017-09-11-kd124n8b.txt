    Notes:
        - What Gregg will be interested in: 
            How will we support cross-cloud deployment?
            Where will we deploy GPII for upcoming pilots? (AWS, see document) ?
            How will we support high-availability, upgradability without outages, etc. ?

Colin will create a first draft of the presentation.
