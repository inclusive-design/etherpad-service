* Discuss technical hands-on session with Yuval this week (when? what time? what is the exercise?)
	* Be explicit about what we want: you will use minikube, you will screen-share with us to demonstrate
	* Another idea: internal load balancer to mitigate errors with load balancer retries: https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2676/
	* Good problems are collaborative. Learn what it's like to work with someone. Problem is open-ended enough that candidate can engage some different strategies and we have a conversation about it.
	* Schedule Colin for last 15-20 minutes to follow-up. OOO Friday. 2pm-onward
	
	
	* Couple of minor updates from Brendan:
		* Vault scripts/packer/terraform/etc
			* Remaining: how do we want to do unlocks? Via a bastion or directly over the Internet?
			* SGs etc. that can talk to Vault
		* Snapshot backup
			* Remaining: I swear, I will destroy AWS with its apparently-nondeterministic APIs
		* Dynamo backup (needed for Vault)
			* Likely do that today, there are some Lambda-based Dynamo dumpers
				* If you didn't know (I didn't), the official Dynamo backup solution is to spin up an EMR Cluster
					* So... lol, no.
				* Eventually this will be "something, something, dump to S3, autoreplication to audit bucket"

Probably one Vault with path determination for dev/stg/prd - things coming from this [instnace profiile | iam role] can only access [env]/*

Colin's availability for interview this week
	* Wednesday 1 pm EST onward
	* Thursday all day
	* Friday at lunch time 12:45-2 pm EST

This is the email that Gio sent Tyler prior to the hands-on interview, in case it helps:
    
Hello Tyler,

   You've probably been in talks with Sandra Ellet-Salmoran about a
technical position with Raising the Floor, right? Avtar and I will be
the ones interviewing you today.

  <Perhaps a little description here of what we'll do e.g. "We'll be collaborating on a task to do x. We'll do this remotely using screensharing...etc.">
   If you could ensure your computer has the following tools installed,
it would be great to avoid any issues before the interview starts:

- Skype (for screen sharing and group call)
- VirtualBox (a recent version, 5.0.28 or 5.1.8)
- minikube (https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/releases/tag/v0.12.2)
- kubectl (https://coreos.com/kubernetes/docs/latest/configure-kubectl.html)

  Sorry for the short notice. Looking forward to meeting you today!

Regards,
Giovanni Tirloni
