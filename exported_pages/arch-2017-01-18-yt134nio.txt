Suggestions for topics for scalability and performance workshop/training 
* Use of JavaScript/Node.js/Chrome debugging and profiling tools for tracing bottlenecks and hotspots in code
* Modern strategies for scaling and clustering CouchDB
* Node.js/microservices-based security techniques
* Operational concerns for scaling node.js SOA - what tools did you use? what problems did you encounter? how did you do logging and metrics and graphing and alerting?
* Strategies for shipping and maintaining Electron-based desktop apps
* Maybe ideas from Node.js Performance Workshop - https://nodesource.com/resources/presskit/services/training/nodesource_training-performance_datasheet.pdf
  * or this workshop itself? :)
* strategies for automated performance testing
