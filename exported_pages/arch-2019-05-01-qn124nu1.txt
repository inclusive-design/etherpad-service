    Installing language packs for Office

Tony:

	1. Working through feedback on the GSS pull, thanks to Antranig for that.
	1. Submitted an infusion docs PR to add searching to the static site.  Finished initial improvements requested, just need to add testem tests.
	1. Pull to standardise Infusion CI builds to use "npm test" was merged, which also means we now have browser pack tests.
	1. Various UL imports work.

Tyler:
* Demo GCR
* Update couchdb and nginx-ingress in production
	* Total reduced availability: about 30 seconds
	* Total deploy time including monitoring some key stats: about 10 minutes
* FYI: Docker Hub had a security incident: https://success.docker.com/article/docker-hub-user-notification
* IGQotW: "After we deploy with individuals (sometime this summer) - then we will need to find a way to update a second system and swap so that Morphic doesnâ€™t go offline at all for updates."


AGENDA:
What is Morphic 1.2 for?
* New functionality requested by pilot leads
* We have more flexibility in non-NOVA sites to do upgrades, as we have people who can go on-site to do upgrades, fewer devices
* Gregg has a spreadsheet. Pilot leads vote for features they want
	* Some things that were moved out of 1.1
	* Major item: MS Office simplification
* What about technical debt?
	* Sandra and Javi collecting, will prioritize with feature requests from PLs
	* Gregg is aware that addressing the debt is important
* This is one reason there is no currently scheduled delivery date for 1.2
