Alfredo
	* Sorted the files of Vagrant-QIenv? (is that name good for the plugin?)
	* https://github.com/amatas/vagrant-qienv
	* Trying to publish the Gem in order that everyone could do "vagrant plugin install vagrant-qienv" vagrant-ci-env gpii-vagrant-ci-env!
		* https://rubygems.org/gems/vagrant-qienv
	* Troubleshooting Tony's QI repository setup
		https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/2123

Avtar
	* Finished up work on https://github.com/avtar/docker-push-ref-gitlab
	* Need to set up one of Tony's projects that contains gpii-webdriver and aXe work with Gitlab CI so that it can be used for P4A demos
	* Planning APCP and P4A tasks today
	* Will be spending majority of time on P4A review tasks but still available for infra calls

Giovanni:
    - Worked on investigating the yarn issue reported by Tony last week
    - More work on Polymer build container, not much progress there (still issues sharing volumes and not a good way to make it easy for developer without making the commands more and more complicated)
    - Working on a Docker entrypoint script to manage volume permissions
    * Time permitting, will try to tackle some tasks in GPII-2009


Agenda:

	* Name the "Vagrant QI plugin":
		* Vagrant-ci-env
		* Vagrant-qi-env
		* GPII-vagrant-ci-env
		* gpii-vagrant-ci
		* Other plugin names (for reference): https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/wiki/Available-Vagrant-Plugins
		* vagrant-gpii-ci <---- WINNER! (to follow the pattern ^^^ )
	* Path towards multi-vm and archs
		* Windows
			* One option would be to use a small Ansible Linux control host that talks to Windows VMs
			* Or Vagrant mult-machine support https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/multi-machine/ (preferred option)
				* Would need to make sure one host (win8.1) is brought up first, jobs run, output gathered on a console, before another host (win10) is made to do the same
					* "autostart: false" for each vm in a Vagrantfile could be a starting point, and then use "vagrant up win8.1" to bring up one env before proceeding to the next
				* Example: https://github.com/coreos/coreos-vagrant (see how config.rb works)
				* https://github.com/amatas/vagrant-vmenv/blob/master/envs/production.yml
		* Concerns about migrating Windows Powershell scripts over to Node.js -- need stronger case made about this, benefits are not clear, drawbacks are somewhat clearer.
	* Giovanni will be away from Dec 26 until Jan 9
	* Tyler's induction - what will be his scope?


https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2009
	* Deadlines ?
	* Kubernetes 1.5 will not have CentOS packages in the near future
		* Rebuild existing rpm packages?
		* Use a playbook to place binaries on hosts, create users, directories, etc?
