		* Participated in i18n discussions
		* Created a grunt task for assembling message bundles for different locales
		* Implementing a component which distributes messages to all internationalizable components in the PSP

	* Using Atkins' testing and test coverage on gpiii-master and GPII-2775
		* on master, process reporter has little coverage, about 30%

Simon:
	* Reviewed and merged Cindy's GPII-2558
	* Reviewing GPII-2630
		* https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/591
	* Is the term "GPII Key" stable?
		* -> how could we ever know? : P [this is a fair response :) maybe I can ask: does anyone know if it is no longer current?]
		* -> I have no evidence that they are not current (AB) Awesome, thanks
	* Investigating intermittent failure
		* See end of https://ci.gpii.net/job/universal-node-tests/735/console
		* "FATAL ERROR: Uncaught exception: Error: Parse error on line 1: User with GPII key t"
		* What we think we know so far:
			* It looks like it only happens on the GPII-2630 branch
			* It looks like the failure happens in UserLogonStateChangeTests.js
			* When diffing a successful run of all-tests.js against a failing run, I see that in the successful run, a call to /user/testUser1/proximityTriggered is debounced:
			* "FATAL ERROR: Uncaught exception: Proximity trigger ignored due to bounce rules. Please wait current logon change is complete"
			* Whereas, in the failing run, it is not debounced
			* Perl script to repeatedly run all-tests.js: https://gist.github.com/simonbates/a6d3f6906f0e8f5ebaa1844003245c4d
