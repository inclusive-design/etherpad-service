Tony:

	1. Wrote up examples and background information for one key part of the PCP API JSON Schema discussion happening in this room in 2.5 hours.  See the mailing list.
	1. Worked on a minor feature request for the Unified Listing, to link back to vendor records.
	1. In pushing through updates to dependencies, I discovered that base grades in gpii-pouchdb are now configured in a way that causes problems when used with gpii-pouchdb-lucene.  As the fix is only needed in my work, I temporarily used a bit of distributeOptions trickery to relocate the problematic options.  I wanted to ask about the long term plans for options deletion, and thought it might be of wider interest.
	1. Continuing to work with Antranig on pulls, we are down to four at the moment.
	1. Thanks to Cindy for feedback on the "universal code coverage" PR.  I responded to her request with more information and small fixes. 
		* Hi Tony, I made another comment after your last response (Great, will look at it in the morning) Thanks, TONY
	1. Reviewed the filter Sandra sent around and commented on open issues assigned to me.  Everyone please do the same.
	1. After reading this article, switched to Opera as my daily driver: https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/leave-chrome-for-opera  I wanted to mention that the RESTED plugin for Opera is pretty reasonable for testing REST APIs, as an alternative to Postman.

    * GPII-2389: Designing terraform CI/CD workflow


Agenda Items
	* UIO+ questions
		* UX (I guess we can schedule a meeting with UX)
			* Where does the Table of Contents get injected into a page, or should we use a browser extension ( will require user interaction to display )?
			* What are the controls for TTS read and highlight all text on the page (with play/pause button and auto-read mode)? What happens to highlight when paused?
			* What is the UI for syllabification (e.g. only change highlighted text, all text, use dialog or change inline, and etc.)?
			* I'd recommend writing up a quick document that outlines your questions and gives some context for them, including, if possible, screenshots that show the current behaviour of UIO
			* When that document is ready, I can take it to the UX team and get them to work through answers to it
			* Action item: Justin will prepare the above, he and Colin will talk about it and the send it up to the UX team
		* settings ( "*" denotes settings that do not currently exist ) Action item: Justin will pair up with Kasper to understand the current process
			* Text Size -> fontSize
			* Line spacing -> lineSpace*
			* Colour contrast -> highContrastEnabled and highContrastTheme
			* Character spacing -> characterSpace*
			* Larger links and form controls -> inputsLargerEnabled*
			* TTS read and highlight all text on the page (with play/pause button and auto-read mode) -> selfVoicingEnabled
			* TTS read and highlight selected text -> selfVoicingSelectionEnabled*
			* Table of contents -> tableOfContentsEnabled*
			* Dictionary -> dictionaryEnabled*
			* Simplification -> SimplifiedUiEnabled
			* Syllabification -> syllabification*
	* Options deletion (time permitting)
