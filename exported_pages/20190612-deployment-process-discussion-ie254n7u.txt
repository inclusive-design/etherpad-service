Still working to deploy the validation changes mentioned here: https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3968
Needs to have links to all issues that are brought in by the release.

	* Last week, tried to run the deployment process
	* But, the wrong version of universal was used in the deployment pull request
	* Tony made a new pull request with the correct version of universal
		* Second pull request: https://github.com/gpii-ops/gpii-infra/pull/417
	* The "how-to" find the version of universal to deploy:  https://github.com/gpii-ops/gpii-infra/blob/master/gcp/README.md#i-want-to-deploy-a-new-version-of-universal-to-production
		* Takes you to a Jenkins web page showing the "docker-gpii-universal-master" that was built from the merge into master (of universal)
	* Perhaps Tony can improve the README based on what he learned by going through this: https://github.com/gpii-ops/gpii-infra/blob/master/gcp/README.md#i-want-to-deploy-a-new-version-of-universal-to-production


Tony to create a shared filter pointing to open deployments and send a note to the group with instructions regarding how to subscribe to get notifications when new deployments are created, et cetera.

Link the deployment JIRA with other JIRAs that describe original issues that are fixed and included in this deployment.

Two kinds of changes for deployment
	* Some are "internal" that the developer and ops check, but do not need Q/A from Kavya
		* E.g., changes to the way the database is maintained
	* Some are changes that affect the way the system works for end users and do require Q/A
	*
