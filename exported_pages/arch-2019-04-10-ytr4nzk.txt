0GPII Architecture Meeting Minutes, April 10th, 2019.


UPDATES:
 Javi and JJ are working on debugging issues with next 1.1.0 installer. 

Sandra:
    - Work continues to deliver Morphic 1.1.0. Javi, JJ and Steve debugging and fixing last few bugs. 
    - Training of student volunteers took place Monday and Tuesday of this week at NOVA. We'll start deploying as soon as we have a new installer with all major issues fixed. 
    - Updating the Timeline with Gregg. I think the next major deliverable will be the ability to install at home. 

Alfredo
	* Working on backup exporter for the GPII cloud
		* New permissions and backup policies.

Bryan 
	* Met with Steven Githens about capture tool acceptance tests
	* Stubbed out skeleton for acceptance tests
	* Currently writing tests doe getSystemSettingsCapture

Joseph:
	* GPII-3333: Production configuration tests for cloud based flow manager endpoints
		* Remove extra access tokens added to the database as a side effect of these tests.
		* Waiting for review
		* https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/718
	* GPII-3832: Handle production configuration tests in the cloud (AWS and GCP)
		* Pull request for AWS, removing the tests
		* Reviewed by Tyler, Alfredo, and Stepan.
		* https://github.com/gpii-ops/gpii-infra/pull/347
		* Thinking about what to do for GCP -- want to run them here in some environment, likely only the dev environment (not stg nor prd)
	* GPII-3646: Periodic archive of access token records, then delete them from the database
		* Rough code that:
			* finds all the expired access tokens and appends them to a file, e.g. "AccessTokensArchive.json"
			* deletes them from Couch after archiving them.
			* option to ignore the expiration date, and archive/delete all of them.
			* https://github.com/klown/universal/blob/GPII-3646/scripts/archiveAndFlushAccessTokens.js
		* Is writing them to a file enough in terms of an archive?

	* Working on 1.2 release - End of April

	* Early windows version testing
