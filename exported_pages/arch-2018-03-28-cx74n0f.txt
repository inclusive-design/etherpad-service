Joseph
	* GPII-2908:  Justin's JIRA about *-testSpec.js tests not running
		* https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2908
		* Checked that they are running, (they are effectively "listed twice" ), and made a comment on the JIRA
		* Tony looked into that, and utlimately made pull request, removing the duplicates.
	* GPII-2578 Stegru's modifications to make more use of the ProcessReporter components
		* Reviewed his two pull requests (windows and universal).
		* Looks good.
		* https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2578
	* Improving test coverage of the process reporter components
		* For debugging, switched to running the unit tests in node
		* Coverage improved, mysteriously.
		* Reports here on github: http://clown.idrc.ocad.ca/GPII/
		* Emailed Tony about this to get his advice


Justin

Steve Grundell
- Stop/restarting windows explorer, GPII-2844
- WRote a test harness for windows settings, https://github.com/stegru/WindowsSettingsTool
- Fixing several PRs

Steve Githens:
Is definitely going to write something this time!  He's a good guy!

Tony:
	1. Continued working on various code coverage pulls:
		2. On the universal pull, researched issues around requiring testSpec files. Should be ready to go. Thanks, Joseph! My pleasure!
		2. On the windows pull, Antranig pointed out that failing test runs still generated coverage reports.  In researching, I discovered that failure in the processHandler tests returned the wrong exit code. Need to review my workaround.
		2. Started working on a gpii-app code coverage spike, I can get partial coverage reporting, but may need to pair with someone more familiar with electron on that. Volunteers? <- probably we could lend a hand (Astea)
	1. Wrote up proposals to cover two key questions for schema-validated components and using schemas in UIs (see agenda):
			3. How to handle UI hints and errors: http://the-t-in-rtf.github.io/infusion-and-json-schema-feedback-two.html
			3. How to reuse and extend schema definitions from a parent grade: http://the-t-in-rtf.github.io/infusion-and-json-schema-reuse-two.html

Tyler:
    * Investigating move from Amazon Web Services to Google Cloud:
        * Rationale (teased during last week's meeting): https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y95Wkl2LYTF12CufM-_c6MANRIKvx42rMEGeH7UpJ5I/edit
    * Preparing a demo / architecture overview of GPII Cloud Infrastructure for Gregg (and Sandra, and others upon request)




AGENDA:
    
Time permitting:

"reuse" concerns around options merging and JSON schemas, as outlined: http://the-t-in-rtf.github.io/infusion-and-json-schema-reuse-two.html
Talking about using "local merge policies" as outlined here: https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5668

"UI" concerns around JSON schemas, as outlined: http://the-t-in-rtf.github.io/infusion-and-json-schema-feedback-two.html

---------------------------

Let it be remembered Ale was a kind and joyful person. He will live in ours hearts and minds.
