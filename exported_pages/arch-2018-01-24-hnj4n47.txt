    IoD discussions

Tony:

		* Started the preliminary work for the i18n spike I discussed with various of you in late 2017.
				* Reviewed previous tickets, notes, technical reviews, relative infusion docs and source.
				* updated fluid.stringTemplate to support deeper paths to material, instead of just top-level keys. (Awaiting review)
				* Moved the message resolver out of Renderer.js and into its own separate file. (awaiting review, same PR)
				* Wrote the initial docs for the gpii-handlebars message-helper that Antranig, Steve and I have been discussing (sometimes here).
		* Automated UL API import and reporting scripts so that task can be handed over post P4A.
		* Cleaned up a bunch of EASTIN records using our cached copy of their records and updated transformation rules. 
		* The Windows code coverage pull still needs final review. 

Tyler:
    * prd and stg are back and upgraded
    * Design and code reviews: vault scripts, hardening standards, LDAPS, vagrant-gpii-ci


AGENDA:

Cindy: Shall we continue to test the trusted flow manager in the production config? If yes, which part should be running live?
	* The current test for it: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/tests/ProductionConfigTests.js#L75
		* This appears to connect to the *production* server; is that correct? If so, that's problematic.
	* It connects to the live preferences server to retrieve user preferences
	* With the change of GPII-2630, the prefs server is no longer a standalone server, it will become a subcomponent of the flow manager
	* The decision is to axe this test and only test the live cloud based flow manager
