1. Anything to demo this week?
  - No
  
2. Review key metrics - https://pad.gpii.net/mypads/?/mypads/group/gpii-infrastructure-standups-lix4njm/pad/view/key-metrics-for-infrastructure-pc1g4nnd
 - Nothing interesting

3. Sandra asked about  GPII-4094
- wrong ticket linked, updated to point to 
  - Web security scanning (GPII-3642)
  - container security scanning (GPII-3641) 

4. Pipeline
  - not great to block pipeline for 2 weeks
  - seems deployed code was not tested in dev (no need for stg)
  - maybe separate deploy of Infra from Universal?
