PRs

	1. Tray Button (GPII-3540)
		2. https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/222
		2. https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/pull/70
	1. Fix for "Reset desktop shortcut" (GPII-3455) Sandra: GPI-3455 is not listed in Timeline in PLAIN LANGUAGE.  Javi: This appeared after the move to electron 3
		2. https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/pull/71
	1. Slowness and SVG (GPII-3597) Sandra: Gregg didn't consider this a show-stopper for 1.0.1.
		2. New SVG merged but still causing slowness
		2. Only animate the spinner when it's shown https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/pull/76
		2. Bern asked to replace the SVG animation with an animated GIF 4 days ago (https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3597?focusedCommentId=36502&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-36502)
			3. @SteveGrundell, shall we do this and abandon the idea of showing the animation at startup?
				4. yes - it might not work anyway, since everything is loading - but the SVG will look smoother than a GIF, so I'd suggest merge 3.2 and keep the SVG (okay)
	1. Language persists in some places (GPII-3558)
		2. https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/723
			3. @SteveGrundell, do you think it isn't really needed and that https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/230 fixes the issue for sure?
				4. It's also needed - the UWP applications use that key (and I think browsers? I think so )
	1. Wallpaper not restoring after high contrast change (GPII-2618)
		2. https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/724 <- ignore
		2. https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/234

Other issues:
	1. The QS "Screen Zoom" and the PSP "DPI Scale factor" settings' ranges differ (GPII-3608) - Can be bumped to 1.1
	1. Installed language codes should be provided with capitalised region (GPII-3605) - Can be bumped to 1.1
		2. Discussions happening on IRC at this moment
		2. https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/232

	* Last tested:
		* GPII-2618: https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/234 works great - [MERGED]
		* GPII-3558: Hard to reproduce/test and even harder to fix, but let's say it's "mostly" fixed - There might be cached leftovers that go away within minutes or eventually after a reboot
			* https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/723 - [MERGED]
			* https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/230 - [MERGED]
		* GPII-3605: https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/232 works good - Antranig can review Sandra: Please don't hold up 1.0.1 new installer for this one. Gregg indicated it's not a show-stopper. 
	* Still under review (and tested before):
		* Tray Button (GPII-3540) (Review in progress)
			* https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/222 [MERGED]
			* https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/pull/70 [MERGED]
		* Fix for "Reset desktop shortcut" (GPII-3455)
			* https://github.com/GPII/pii-app/pull/71

After going through the Morphic 1.0.1 Reported Issues  (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MGpFf70ViEZhv34cJmBGB-gv7oSWbIR88-_mHPv0rQ0/edit?ts=5c4241e7#) - We decided that the following ones are showstoppers:

	* GPII-3605: https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/232 [MERGED]
	* GPII-3597: https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/pull/76 [MERGED]

We also need to create a batch script that removes the "Reset to STD" file with the old format. 
We also identified the following issues that need to be reported and assigned to the right person
