Agenda:
1. Anything to demo this week?
	* Tyler GCP intro changes - wait for Cindy and Joseph training?
	* We have a topic for this Wednesday: continuation of Tony "managing deployment of code" discussion - Sandra will confirm with him tomorrow
	* Stepan Istio demo would be great, but we're not quite ready (demo for ops first, push it to prd, ready to go before sharing with that audience)
2. Review key metrics
	* What are the key metrics worth reviewing?
		* locust flowmanager and locust preferences dashboards
			* https://app.google.stackdriver.com/dashboards/10929930954431642073?project=gpii-gcp-prd&timeDomain=6w
			* https://app.google.stackdriver.com/dashboards/10150992811830444288?project=gpii-gcp-prd&timeDomain=6w
		* couch various metrics dashboard
			* https://app.google.stackdriver.com/dashboards/10150992811830444288?project=gpii-gcp-prd&timeDomain=6w
		* 500s and other errors
			* We don't collect these metrics today. They would come from nginx I guess
			* Istio will provide a bunch of these metrics
				* Need to configure Istio to submit metrics, but then they are surfaced to stackdriver
				* No automatic dashboards but metrics will show up
				* Service monitoring with stackdriver is supposed to come to beta to help with this, but we don't know when it will land (probably not too soon)
		* couchdb latency
			* Not sure what metric we currently collect might give us this
		* Overall utilization of cluster: cpu, memory, etc.
			* GCP Dashboard -> prd -> Compute -> Instances -> Open each one -> Monitoring
	* Tyler will find a place to persist these metrics (e.g. top of standup pad) for future reference
	* More metrics from user side. Ask for insights from Pilot team, ES metrics, etc.
		* Alfredo will ask Yao about this
		* Raise it in arch weekly?
