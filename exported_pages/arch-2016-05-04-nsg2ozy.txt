	* https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-1543

		* Implement all of the AsTeRICS lifecycle behaviour in the NexusConnector

Tony:
	* Updated the rest of the important open PRs (gpii-json-schema, gpii-express-user) for their own reviews.  Now (finally!) updating the UL API for its code review.
	* The UL work is highlighting follow up work in other packages, but these are hopefully smaller incremental improvements.  Currently, we are discussing how gpii.express.handler instances should deal with errors.
	* Used to think Canadians were nice, until Colin convinced me to work on KETTLE-32.  Currently looking through topics previously discussed with Antranig, reviewing the docs.  Will look through the tests next.
	* Spiked a new approach to using testem and gpii-express together (see mailing list).  Used this to test CORS support in the updated UL API (required for the SAA and possibly the user review tool).
	* Also had to spike a quick approach to handling CORS errors correctly, which required bypassing jQuery.ajax(), which does not fire its "error" function when a CORS error occurs (apparently, by design).  I ended up using XHR directly.  How are other people handling this?


TOPICS:
    
Antranigs Giant Pull request (GPII-1318)
	* The pull request for supporting the LTS version of node.js (and express) in universal, kettle (KETTLE-32), windows and linux is ready for a second round of review
	* Kasper, Javi, Cindy, Colin Clark and Simon (and Tony) should ALL prioritize reviewing our respective part (and the overall) of the pull request so we can get it in
	* Quite a few pull requests are depending on this
	* Pull requests against 4 repos:
		* https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/425 (biggest)
		* https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/67
		* https://github.com/GPII/linux/pull/76 (has pulls of its own from jhernandez and clown)
		* https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle/pull/21
