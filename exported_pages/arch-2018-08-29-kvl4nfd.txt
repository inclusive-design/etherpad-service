Tony:

	1. Revised settings per feedback from the JAWS team in last week's onboarding meeting.
	1. Evaluated the work to be done to bring the UL and PTD up to date enough to use CouchDB 2.0.
	1. Started work on a new globbing library to improve our build ("npm install") time in Infusion and other packages.  Initial testing suggests that we could save 90% of the time in linting runs, and potentially also in "dist" steps.
	1. Released a new version of gpii-testem that should no longer output "setRawMode" errors when existing dev mode.
