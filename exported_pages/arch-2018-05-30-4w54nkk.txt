AGENDA
	* Catch-up with JJ on his findings on failing tests (Antranig)
		* Presumably we have two problems - one, the fault in CI which claims that Windows pulls pass
		* Secondly, the problem itself (something to do with high contrast?)
		* Earliest (so far) successful fail: https://ci.gpii.net/job/windows-acceptance-tests/400/console
		* https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/164
			* Pull request for GPII-2795: "Update to work with node 8.9.4"
			* The crashes are random, so this work itself may not be implicated
			* 12:26:29.775:  SCardSvr service not running - PC/SC user listener not available.
			* 12:26:29.775:  PC/SC user listener is not available.
			* doitclient.exe : doit: remote error: GetExitCodeProcess failed
			*     + CategoryInfo          : NotSpecified: (doit: remote er...eProcess failed:String) [], RemoteException
			*     + FullyQualifiedErrorId : NativeCommandError
			* Finished: SUCCESS
		* Not clear what is implicated - whether it is Windows High Contrast setting or not
			* It appears that setting high contrast makes the issue more likely, but may not be the direct cause
		* Stegru has tested with node 8.2.1 and has still seen the problem
		* Stegru has also removed all edge.js stuff and it still fails
		* Hypothesis is also that process crashes with exit code of 0 which is what leads to CI not detecting the problem
		* Another line of investigation - it appears that gpii-app doesn't suffer from this problem since I (Antranig) run its tests pretty intensively and have not seen such a crash
			* It may be that its version of node doesn't have the problem OR
			* It may be that it is bound to a version of gpii-windows that predates the problem
		* We should file this as its own JIRA, or pair of JIRAs
	* JIRA's new status for tickets? (Antranig)
		* We have a new issue "link type" - it is named "git code review opened" and has a reverse link type "opened during git code review in"
		* What does this link type mean, does anyone know who added it?
		* We can't find who has done this, and it does not appear in the audit log
