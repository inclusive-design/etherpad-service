			* Initially tried to do this in 2008

Simon:
	* Continuing on with Nexus development

Steve Grundell
	* GPI-2226 screen scaling: done, but unit tests not passing due to resolution
	* Started proof of concept for starting GPII from a service
		* Installing service is very easy
		* Able to start process as the current user
		* Just need to do the anonymous pipe
	* re-starting GPII-1716, font-size (without dpi)

Tony:
	1. Started working on gpii-testem, a new project to help expand the usefulness of gpii-testem: https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2296
	1. Came up with a proof-of-concept client-side dataSource grade.
	1. Wrote up the available options for URL parsing for the client-side dataSource as a technical evaluation.

Agenda:

	* (Joseph, JJ) GPII-442:  Bring back process state tracking functionality to the ProcessesBridge
		* JJ would like to use it for Onboarding.
		* Bring back "asi-is" vs. infusion StateTracker vs. something else
		* Would like Kasper's perspective here
	* In Microsoft Word Learning tools, there is no way to trigger settings like line spacing - there are no persistent settings - using UI Automation API
	* You are given a list of UI element Ids - but these are not published for the Learning Tools
	* This can be done in an event driven way, without polling
	* So this doesn't look like a use case for Joseph's state tracker, since we can deal with an autonomous asynchronous process
	* 
	* Javi, on behalf of Kasper: Regarding merging the pull requests for HST
		* Kasper has tried the gpii-app pull and it worked, but ... how do we feel about merging the gpii-app pull even if it's not CI passing? The only blocking one is https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/112 (the one about the nearest screen resolution)
