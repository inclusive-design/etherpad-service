Simon's List

From the academic end-user programming community:

- I found these resources that might be helpful in identifying people
   - "The State of the Art in End-User Software Engineering" http://repository.cmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1306&context=hcii
   - EUSES (End Users Shaping Effective Software) Consortium http://eusesconsortium.org/
- Alan Blackwell
   - Or maybe some of his past/current students: http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/rainbow/people/
- Margaret Burnett
   - http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~burnett/
   - Though her GenderMag [http://gendermag.org/] project is maybe a little odd -- am I right in remembering that either you or Jutta had some interaction with her or her work during a visit to Microsoft?
- Brad Myers
   - Or one of his students
   - http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bam/
- Andrew Ko
   - http://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/

Maybe someone from Mitchel Resnick's Lifelong Kindergarten group?

- Natalie Rusk

Maybe someone from the Y Combinator HARC group?

- Alan Kay and Bret Victor are here
- This was the group that Vi Hart's eleVR group was part of
- https://harc.ycr.org/member/
- https://harc.ycr.org/project/
- Recent work on Dynamicland looks pretty interesting
- https://twitter.com/Dynamicland1
- John Maloney

Evelyn Eastmond
   - Was a member of eleVR with Vi Hart
   - Worked on Scratch at MIT

Taeyoon Choi
   - Co-founder School for Poetic Computation

"Creative coding" world:

- John Maeda
   - Led the "Design By Numbers" project that Processing grew out of
   - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_By_Numbers
   - Though it looks like he is not involved in academia much any more: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Maeda

- Daniel Shiffman
   - Teaches Processing
   - http://shiffman.net/about/

Authorship/creativity within video games might be an interesting angle

- Minecraft is a big thing right now
   - Not sure who might be good to discuss Minecraft though
   - I did find this edited book that might be a good resource to look at, if this would be interesting:
   - "Understanding Minecraft: Essays on Play, Community and Possibilities (Minedraft) Paperback" by Nate Garrelts   http://www.mcfarlandbooks.com/contents-2.php?id=978-0-7864-7974-0

- Noah Wardrip-Fruin
   - https://games.soe.ucsc.edu/people/noah-wardrip-fruin

- Gita Jackson
   - Currently writes for Kotaku
   - Writes on the topics of The Sims, game avatar creation tools, house decorating apps, fashion apps, and fan culture
   - https://kinja.com/gitasj
   - Recent example: https://kotaku.com/anime-fans-are-making-their-favorite-characters-out-of-1820507366
   - She might not be the best person as she isn't from academia and her Kotaku posts are not super in depth but she has written longer pieces before Kotaku
   - Example of longer-form: https://boingboing.net/2015/03/20/we-are-not-colonists-2.html
   - There might be someone from academic games criticism that might be a better fit

- Zack Barth
   - http://www.zachtronics.com/
   - Created Infiniminer, one of the games that influenced Minecraft
   - He creates puzzle-solving games that involve creativity in their solving
   - Though the creativity does tend towards creativity of the feel of engineering and computer programming
   - I'm playing SpaceChem at the moment
   - Talk at Google: https://youtu.be/Df9pz_EmKhA
