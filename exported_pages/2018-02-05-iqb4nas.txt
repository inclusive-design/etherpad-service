Agenda: 
    - Follow-up from last week's call regarding retrospective or lessons learned:
        (silence means everything's peachy)
	* are we planning effectively?
		* do you know what your priorities are, generally?
		* do you konw what your priorities are this sprint?
		* do you know why they're priorities?
		* do you think they're the right priorities, in general?
		* does our planning process provide us with insights into our team's metrics—how long stuff takes us, etc.
	* are we meeting efficiently?
	* are we getting enough technical time with each other?
	* do we have opportunities to work together in smaller groups as needed? 
	* do we have the appropriate skills on our team?
	* are our goals and priorities sufficiently clear? [and how could we make them more so?]

Discussion Notes:
	* Sandra: we could do a better job of mentioning and describing the priorities while we're doing sprint planning
		* Adjustments to sprints at the end
		* Tie in to higher-level priorities ("a production environment in the public cloud"), focus on next deliverables
	* Tyler:
		* 4 ceremonies in Scrum (standup, demo, retrospective, planning)
			* we're strongest at planning—pretty good
			* priorities are clear—have lots of influence over what the priorites are
			* we're a little weaker at connection from what ops is doing to the organization's goals—not bad, but could be improved
		* our metrics are pretty good, story points are aligned, some concern about finishing things within a sprint—granularity of tasks? makes it difficult to know when we'll be finished
			* more fined-grained tasks might be part of the issue - easier/more accurate to esitmate smaller work items than larger work items
				* Include space for learning about the problem, research and documenting possible solutions
				* more "research spikes"? e.g. "implement a security gateway" -> one day spike, followed by further breakdown of tasks?
				* Sandra: have planned one sprint for research and design (if needed); next sprint plan would break down the researched area into finer tasks (done prior to planning)
				* How important are accurate estimates? Improving accuracy of estimates requires additional effort. We should not expend that effort unless it has business value
	* Brendan:
		* FERPA compliance must be in place before launching in educational environment (community college)
		* All tickets he has ever written in Jira must be resolved before we are there
			* With the exception of the LDAPS tickets, which can be addressed later.
		* Completing ISO 27002 evaluation
			* Alfredo: Can we have more information about this? Brendan: No.
				* That's not what I said. What I said was that the assessment isn't mine to share beyond the project leadership, because it cuts across a large number of functional areas.
		* Dashboard to surface these issues at a high level for the team to feed into prorities? Something we can look at during each spring planning?
			* Brendan: I can repeat these, but the issues I've raised have not been addressed. Because: sufficient attention and resources have not been dedicated to these problems.

Let's start having a dedicated Retrospective meeting. Once per sprint. Separate form regular ops weekly. Start with 30 minutes, learn how to retrospect together effectively.
