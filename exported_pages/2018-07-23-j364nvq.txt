Agenda:
    - Update on onboarding Stepan and Sergio. Things seem to be going well so far. 
    - GPII-3125 heads up about new changes in the projects hierarchy (Alf)
	* Removing Projects that don't follow the naming scheme (like gpii-gcp-dev-tyler)
		* gpii-sai -- talk to someone
	* DNS wrangling
		* Conflict between our common/ code and exekube, both trying to manage DNS zones for dev clusters
			* Do it ourselves vs delegate to exekube
			* The problem is permissions
			* We have a dependency between DNS zones. Parent must point to Child zones. If a developer deletes their Child zone, that zone disappears from the Parent zone. If developer re-creates, it's not connected to Parent.
				* What's implemented now is the simplest thing. The "fix the link between parent and child eventually" is more complex.
				* Can we make exekube only manage records, and not the zone? Alfredo says it's "inside a core module" so it might require a fork.

				* Sergey proposes common/ calculating zones from tfstate files. This was part of the solution Tyler and Alfredo developed, but Alfredo is worried that it's complicated.
				* Import pre-existing zone every time developer runs rake in order to avoid new creation of the developers' new DNS zone and reuse the one created by gpii-common
					* Stepan favors this approach. Tight coupling between zone and where it is used.
