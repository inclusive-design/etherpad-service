Covering Javi while on vacation - installer creation

Attendees: Steves and Javi 

THINGS YOU NEED TO KNOW BEFORE GETTING TO THE INSTALLER CREATION
----------------------------------------------------------------

1st - Need to know what needs to be included in the build

For you to know this, you will need to be in touch with different people:

  - Anything that applies to universal: Antranig and/or Cindy
  - Anything that applies to windows (onboarding, bugfixes, new stuff): Steve Grundell and/or JJ
  - Anything that applies to gpii-app: HA (mostly for the changes in the UI side) but also Steve Grundell (tray icon, metrics or even installer creation internals)
  - Anything that applies to gpii-wix-installer: Ask Steve Grundell
  - If there's a new functionality in gpii-app that couples with new changes in core (ask Antranig/Cindy), when in windows (ask Steve Grundell)

2nd - Ideally, you should start putting PRs together starting from master branches, but I'd say you should only focus on putting things on top of my GPII-4004 branch while I'm away - And this is a command, DO NOT start from master, create a ticket for the new installer, take the JIRA issue number and create a new branch taking my GPII-4004 as the base branch. Why? Testers don't test things that were working in previous releases. ALWAYS Merge things with "git merge --no-ff --log"

https://github.com/javihernandez/universal/tree/GPII-4004
https://github.com/javihernandez/windows/tree/GPII-4004
https://github.com/javihernandez/gpii-wix-installer/tree/GPII-4004

3rd - Since a lot of things are not in master branches, we're not publishing npm artifacts. We use git refs, which work just fine. REMEMBER: Delete node_modules folder AND package-lock.json file before running npm install.

4th - WE NEVER APPLY FIXES OR HARDCODE THINGS IN CODE - this applies to any js or json file that comes from a repo. If you need to adjust anything, update universal/windows

- RECAP - GOLDEN RULES:

1.- ENSURE YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT NEEDS TO BE INCLUDED - ASK PEOPLE
2.- USE MY GPII-4004 BRANCHES AS STARTING POINT
3.- UPDATE GIT REFS AS NEEDED AND REMOVE NODE_MODULES AND PACKAGE-LOCK.JSON FILE
4.- DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING THAT IS COMING FROM SOURCE CODE
5.- IF YOU STILL HAVE ANY DOUBTS, COUNT ON ME, I'LL BE REACHABLE ALL THE TIME

INSTALLER - COMPONENTS
----------------------

- gpii-app
- gpii-wix-installer: the branch is referenced in gpii-app/provisioning/Installer.ps1
- filebeat/sharex/documorph
  - I'll provide you the msms that you need to put in gpii-app/provisioning
  - in case you need to create a new msm for filebeat (ask Steve Grundell), for sharex and documorph (ask me)
- reset to std preferences: I'll send you the last version and it needs to go into gpii-app/node_modules/gpii-universal/testData/defaultSettings/defaultSettings.json5

{
    "contexts": {
        "gpii-default": {
            "preferences": {

                }
            }
        }
    }
}

- windows service config is located at gpii-app/provisioning: https://github.com/javihernandez/gpii-app/blob/GPII-4004/provisioning/service.json5

- Different gpii-app configs can be found here: https://github.com/javihernandez/gpii-app/tree/GPII-4004/configs

INSTALLER CREATION PROCESS
--------------------------

GOLDEN RULES:

- Follow the process described here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/16iRgCmYv6fx0GZ9xFK43Y77gv9G5v-1HrPNv0O7WGAU/edit?usp=sharing
- IF have questions - ASK ME
- DO NOT FORGET ANYTHING FROM THE PROCESS (THE ONLY EXCEPTION, DO NOT PUBLISH TO NPM BECAUSE WE'RE NOT BUILDING FROM MASTER)
- IF have questions - ASK ME

WHEN EVERYTING'S READY
----------------------

- Rename the installer from Morphic.1212232.3433.msi to Morphic-1.3-<hash-from-fluid-publish-test-output>.msi
- Ask Sandra to create the "Reported issues document" for you - she will provide you the right place to upload the installer
- Add what you think is worth including in the "What's new" section of the doc. This needs to be "user friendly" and useful for testers and to the end-user perspective, so, don't need to include every new commit or PR. Focus on, "fixed things" and "improvements/new features/things that now work in a different way"
- When everything is in place - Send an email as I usually do - Look in your email for "New installer available" and use it as template. Respect the "subject" and PUT ME IN CC (This is how we're keeping track of released installers)
