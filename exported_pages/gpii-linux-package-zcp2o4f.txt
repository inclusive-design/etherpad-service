1. Version of the package.
	Start from nightly snapshot.
	Version: https://github.com/fluid-project/fluid-publish (this code can be reused to generate a development snapshot version for the packages)
	
2. Ansible roles
	- Will not be used ATM, only will try to avoid any duplication of the package list to install
	- How to pick particular versions of the git repositories
		- universal (will pick the latest version of the repo in the snapshots)
		- gpii-linux (will pick the latest version of the repo in the snapshots)
	- provide some means to specify a  'version' == [ branch, hash, tag_name ]
     - update variables and split tasks by environment [ vagrant, buildrpm ]
     Package dependencies:
         - BuildRequires
         - Requires
         Make a script that excludes -dev packages and adds to the Requires statement
	    Write down where the dependencies of packages lists are stored in the README.md
