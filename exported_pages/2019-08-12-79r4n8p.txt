1. Anything to demo this week?
   -> nope

2. Review key metrics - https://pad.gpii.net/mypads/?/mypads/group/gpii-infrastructure-standups-lix4njm/pad/view/key-metrics-for-infrastructure-pc1g4nnd
* Found an unexplained bucket related to backup-exporter
* Found that we are orphaning KMS keys and then paying for them anyway



3. Sprint planning

4. New relic update

Tyler has completed a proof of concept and is able to get system metrics into New Relic. Is this sufficient for Jake's needs?
