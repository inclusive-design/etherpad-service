Tony:

	1. Started the major effort of replacing gpii-pouchdb in universal with the new gpii-couchdb-test-harness.  Required before we can safely merge further large onboarding pulls such as MAGic, JAWS 2019, NVDA, et cetera.
	1. As part of this, I am replacing various outdated test sequence munging strategies with sequence elements and sequence grades: https://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/IoCTestingFramework.html#example-of-sequence-building-using-sequencegrade

Tyler
* Wrapped up performance investigation. Summary of my findings here: https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3394?focusedCommentId=36605&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-36605
* Next: moving developers from AWS to GCP



AGENDA:
    
Updates on:
    
- Migration to GCP (Javi?)
	- GPII-3588 - Update Morphic to point to CBFM in gcp-prd
	- GPII-3589 - Migrate production user data from aws-prd to gcp-prd
	- Should be happening by the end of this week
	
- Liveness/readiness checks progress: (Joseph?/Alf)
	- GPII-3432 - Add liveness / readiness checks to preferences, flowmanager deployments
	  (added JIRA linek from GPII-3432 to GPII-3551)
	- (Joseph:) Bug fixes for /ready and /health flowmanager/preferences/couchdb endpoints were pushed to master in Dec
		- GPII-3551 pull request https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/713
		- the tests are run in a development configuration
		- https://preferences.prd.gcp.gpii.net/ready is returning an error even though preferences seems healthy. So it doesn't seem that the /ready endpoint is ready for use.
		- https://flowmanager.prd.gcp.gpii.net/ready
		- https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3551
		* How did these items get marked finished if they're not working in the cloud in production?
			* Maybe it worked in local Docker-based dev? Maybe it worked in production config tests?
		
	- GPII-3333 is for running analogous tests in a production configuration
		- tests for /health, /ready, /access_token, /%gpiiKey/settings/%device, and /%gpiiKey/settings working, but only using snapsets
		- https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3333
	
- Also leaked creds in logs: (Antranig?)
	- GPII-3309 - Flowmanager and Preferences logs leak credentials
	
- Start planning the implementation of  "Best idea" proposal: Antranig is out today. Will schedule a separate meeting. 
	1. Secret (installation secret )
	1. Hash the UserName
	1. Limit where it can come from  (DOMAIN of NOVA)
	1. Limit how much can be saved before we ask for authentication
		2.  See above for limitations
	1. Validate data against the Solutions REgistry
