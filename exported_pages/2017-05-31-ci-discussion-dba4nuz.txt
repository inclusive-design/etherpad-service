CI discussion
Attendees: Alfredo, Avtar, Colin, Gio, Tyler


	* We will continue to host  the main repositories on Github
		* Github provides us free features (private repos?)
		* Github has critical mass of community
		* Workflows settled on Github
	* We want to replace Jenkins with the CI features in GitLab
	* GitLab's CI features will only work with git repositories hosted within a GitLab instance
	* So we need to mirror our GitHub repositories in a GitLab instance in order to perform CI tasks on them
	* We need bi-directional communication between GitHub and our GitLab instance:
		* We need to know when changes are pushed to a Github repository (to trigger CI)
		* We need to send the results of a GitLab-managed CI job back to GitHub (in order to reflect build status on GitHub pull request pages, for example)
	* Cross repo CI job triggering to appear in an upcoming 9.3 release https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/16556

Possible next steps: GPII-2448
	* Host an instance of GitLab GPII-2439
	* CI runners hosted in the data centre (must be bare metal) GPII-2450
	* A service that mirrors GitHub repos and is capable of pushing CI jobs results to GitHub PR threads https://github.com/avtar/docker-push-ref-gitlab  GPII-2449
	* PRs containing .gitlab-ci.yml files for GPII repos - GPII-2123
	* Webhook payload URLs configured for each of the GPII GitHub repos GPII-2451
	* repo:status token for the above repos GPII-2451
	* Move container configuration for the preferences server, flow manager, and other components in the official Universal repository
		* Set up pipeline stages that build container images and push them to container repos once upstream test suites have passed
