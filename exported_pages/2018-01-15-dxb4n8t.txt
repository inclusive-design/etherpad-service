Agenda:
	* Updates on current sprint progress
		* https://issues.gpii.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=21&projectKey=GPII&view=planning.nodetail
	* Use of Hashi's Vault terraform module
		* Not actually written by Hashi, written by Gruntworkâ€”but in Hashi's Github org
		* Brendan believes the design is not appropriate:
			* Use of console
			* Use of dnsmasq
			* S3 as storage background and layering console on top of that
			* Using Consul as a storage backend raises the number of servers required from 2 to 6
			* 
	* Yuval's list
	* LDAPS

Notes:
    - Alfredo: GPII-2766 merged. Working on the other JIRAs for this sprint as planned.
