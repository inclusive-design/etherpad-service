Scenario
	* Windows 80% and 20% the rest in AJCs

Opportunities for improve
	* Wiki is not the correct place for storing all the infromation related to the onboarding process.
	* Separation between "Community" and "Technical" onboarding process.
	* Tiger Team / Onboarding team members need an special set of skills: a11y basic knowledge and gpii technical knowledge.
	* Costly to integrate / connect with upstream (meaning gpii core)
	* Implementation of new settings handlers have a lack of tool to develop real tests or behaviural/functional tests. (a full user process, in example)
	* UL isn't well documented about how is integrated or how it is supposed to be used from Onboarding team.It
	* It's hard to implement the settings handler for some solutions. Typical problem is that we need to restart tools to apply new settings, because these tools don't support live changes.
	* Lack of technical contact with principal propietary software.

Hints for the reboot of TT/Onboarding Team
	* Landing page needed for begginers
	* It's key to have an stable product defined by "Product Manager" and CD'ed.
	* We have contacs with them but it's hard to maintain the technical communication with them and make progress.
	* CD/CI on.going / was part of TT <- Need to continous testing with the new AT tools integration
	* A management profile is needed in order to focus on the process, and to contact with third party providers

Main AT Tools we should consider
