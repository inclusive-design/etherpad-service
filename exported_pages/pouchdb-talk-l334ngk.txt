Agenda:
    
1. The testing infrastructure for using pouchDB in browser based tests
2. Changes required for gpii-pouchdb for running in for GPII development configuration

1. The testing infrastructure for using pouchDB in browser based tests

What functionality of CouchDB do we use?

	* Get
	* Put
	* Load views
	* Load test data
	* Fetch by views
	* Fetch by document ids

Work to do:

	* Make a new PouchDB data source grade in gpii-pouchdb
	* Finding uses of require
	* Investigate options for interfacing with PouchDB
		* We currently use express-pouchdb to provide a REST API for gpii-pouchdb
		* https://github.com/pouchdb/express-pouchdb
	* Can we use views without express-pouchdb?
		* investigate design document support
		* looks like there are some differences between CouchDB and PouchDB reduce functions
		* https://pouchdb.com/guides/queries.html
		* https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/blob/master/tests/mapreduce/test.mapreduce.js
		* https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/issues/2941

Other options to consider:

	* Mixed browser / Node.js testing (gpii-pouchdb under Node.js)
	* Node.js only

2. Changes required for gpii-pouchdb for running in for GPII development configuration

Work to do:

	* Make a separate base grade that does not do clean up
