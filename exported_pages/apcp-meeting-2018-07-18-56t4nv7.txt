It would be great if there was an automated build of master.

We need a way for a user (like Gregg) to identify the build they are using, to aid in creating meaningful bug reports.

Cloud One Installer and Builds
	1. We need to create our "release integration branch" asap
	1. We need a simplest possible way that someone can find "the latest (proposed) version(s) of the next release"
		2. for QA testing
		2. for demonstration and acceptance testing
	1. 

Change process
	1. Developer tests, thinks their stuff is awesome, makes PR
	1. Our existing CI process (thanks Alfredo) will automatically build the PR, and the installer artefact will be available for download
	1. Kayva or other tests can take the installer for each PR, test it, and verify itâ€”and comment accordingly on the PR
	1. Reviewer reviews and merges
		2. What happens now?
			3. A manual process: the person who pushes a change to the release branch will post the resulting installer - to..?
				4. for now, this is going to be our working process
			3. An automated webhook process: when code gets pushed to the release branch, the installer will be built and posted to our website
				4. javi will estimate how long this implementation will take
