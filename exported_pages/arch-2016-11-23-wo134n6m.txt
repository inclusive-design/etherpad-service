Tony:
	1. Finished UL front end tests (just need to update the docs before submitting PRs).  Only took a year!
	1. Resumed work on all open PRs, focused on areas where other people were blocked, such as gpii-pouchdb.
	1. Submitted new model transforms and docs in separate PRs.
	1. Evaluated the new versions of Confluence and JIRA (see the list).
	1. Talked with Cindy, Colin, Antranig on security planning.
	1. Anyone interested in working together to exercise the work Antranig submitted for https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5903?  ("grade budding" for test sequences).  I plan to identify a relatively isolated package that uses complex IoC tests, if anyone else is already building on this new concept, we can compare notes and/or combine forces.

AGENDA:
    cats (pictures, stories, etc.) - how about dogs?! ok sasquatch? definitely (ok: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigfoot) "some claim it shows a Bigfoot, and others a man in a gorilla suit" maybe it's a cat in a gorilla suit. like this? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niVI1Cy2x2c
