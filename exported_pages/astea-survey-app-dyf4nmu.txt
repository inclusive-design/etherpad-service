Survey server
----------------

Q what kind of application do we want to serve?
A a simple node app with a simple websockets server

A it's a custom app made by ASTEA

Q Can we have this in a git repo?
A sure https://github.com/danailbd/gpii-app/blob/feature/survey_manager/src/main/surveys/surveyServer.js <- this is the current server that we use. We'll probably extract it to a dedicated repo, that we'll create

Q what kind of data are we going to handle?
A The data will be static data, payloads, etc


Astea will provision the VM and will make the backups as needed

https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/

for example: surveyserver.gpii.net (perhaps it can change, ASTEA will send the final name by email)

Date to be ready: ASAP ¬¬

Specs of the VM:
    
    - t2.nano
    - Ubuntu
    - (we need the TCP/UDP ports for security)
    - (we need the SSH public for login)
