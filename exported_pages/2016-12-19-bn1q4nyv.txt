Ops Meeting 12/19/2016
==================

	1. Updates

Ale:
	* Made some test with gitlab-ci-multirunner in my own machine, looks good. But find some problems with the connection to the project, it's a bit cumbersome process to obtain the api key, etc.. because thre's many api keys. Probably we need to automatize that work for the rest of the team.
		* From Avtar: We need to plan carefully the migration to gitlab through middle pieces to have a more flexible and powerful environment for running our jobs. Let's to discuss the viability of this in next Architecture/Core meeting.
	* Asking about AWS migration to start to work on that. Trying to align all the pieces.

Alfredo:
	* Mostly working on SSL infrastructure using LetsEncrypt, that involves:
		* Creation of a playbook to create/renew certificates
		* Change the actual Nginx-reverse role
		* Create a LetsEncrypt account and wrap up all the things
	* Give support of Windows to vagrant-gpii-ci
	* Create a playbook to test Jenkins role

Avtar:
	* Tested Gio's updated Vagrant boxes with GPII/linux and GPII/universal -- can get VMs provisioned and all tests pass. The nexus repo needs a PR so that the correct version of nodejs is installed, currently what is in the master branch will not result in a correctly provisioned VM.
	* Tested https://github.com/GPII/ci-service/pull/23 but could not get it to work as-is. Backslashes in paths need to be escaped.
	* Primarily working on P4A demo tasks.

Giovanni:
	* Refactored common role, inventory files, simplified many things
	* Updated idi-ops/packer-centos-internal-use repository with improvements
	* Tested CentOS 7.3 VM template image with these news changes (VM size went from 1.2GB to ~900MB)
	* Testing CentOS 7.3 upgrade for physical servers and VMs now (will upgrade servers throughout the week)

Agenda Items:

Other topics:
	* Workaround for Packer shutdown issues:
		* Set "shutdown_timeout": "1h", and (perhaps) "headless": false, in the json definition of the box.
	* Gitlab Container: https://github.com/sameersbn/docker-gitlab
	* Question: Makes sense to integrate powershell scripts into the vagrant generation machines scripts? Last time I checked it seems pretty straightforward and it will help to have a tidy and more powerful environment.
	* Question: Do we have a service map for current testing GPII infrastructure?
		* Gio: We need it! :D
		* Gio: Probably makes sense to move all the services and QI services too to the new cloud platform.
		* Alfredo has access to the AWS account of RtF, but have to check if has permission to do so
		* Gio: Will collect an inventory list.
	* Question: Is it worth to move some of the installation of software from our current provisioning scripts to the image generation.
		* Gio: We can have differents flavours of every vm. a complete or full one (with pinned versions of the software) and a vanilla one. Probably the former is going to be better for developers day-to-day usage and the second one for other kind of environment.
