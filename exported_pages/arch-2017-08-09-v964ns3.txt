		* Merged pull requests into gpii-app, pushed updates on windows
		* CI is still failing - looks like a performance problem makes the tests to fail
		* Created pull request with snapsets (merged)

Justin:
	* Waiting for FLUID-6174 PR to be merged before I can finish the GPII/UIO+ integration
		* https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/838
		* https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2501
	* Existing UIO+ work is available for code review
		* https://github.com/GPII/gpii-chrome-extension/pull/2
		* also sent out a build of the UIO+ extension for others to try
			* see GPII-2424 ( https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2424 ) JiRA and GPII architecture mailing list ( http://lists.gpii.net/pipermail/architecture/2017-August/004628.html )
			* have been making small updates based on feedback, e.g. adjuster order
			* filed some new issues like:
				* GPII-2523 ( https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2523 )
				* GPII-2525 ( https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2525 )
				* FLUID-6180 ( https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6180 )
	* Working on FLUID-6176 to add highlighting of words as they are being synthesised
		* https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6176
		* Trying to synchronize the text highlight and synthesizer, highlighting is being added, but on the test site it's not accurate. I think it may be related to difference in how the synthesizer and my own parser handle whitespace.
    
JJ:
	* GPII-2521: Researching about setting mapping, and finishing the work in the upstream onboard of Morpher and Simplification. After Javi corrected me about several parts of the work.

Yuriy:
    * Reviewing the scope of the PCP project and coming up with JIRA tasks that suit the development plan    

    
Agenda:
    - Vacation plans for next week include: Javi is out all of next week; Steve Grundell is out 15-Aug through 17-Aug. Michelle out starting tomorrow for a week. (Kasper and Ale should be back next week. Cindy back later this week.) Antranig is out Aug 10th through Aug 15th
	* GPII-2515 - CI has been changed to use the new `npm run test` commands - PR review is blocking (https://github.com/GPII/linux/pull/94)
	* Our naming of preference sets is becoming very problematic - they are all just thrown into a top-level garbage bin as we now had with https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/535 - and we still have https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-502 open as a task to organise these properly. We were unable to rename the snapsets since there are already NFC tags out in the wild that use these names, and the framework has no means of indirection against these files. We need to support some kind of hierarchical/configurable resolution of preferences from the filesystem together with JSON5 support
	* We have problems in our CI for the GPII app that cause it to run unacceptably slowly (17 seconds to process a logon) - we could increase the timeouts in the framework but it seems better to understand what kinds of resources constraints could cause the GPII to run so slowly and how we can alleviate them
	* Data that is needed for the Morpher and simplification feature: https://gitlab.com/gpii-demos/gpii-app/tree/demo-mainstream/provisioning/demo-data
