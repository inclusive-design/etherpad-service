GPII Architecture Meeting Minutes, June 10th, 2020.

UPDATES:

Antranig:
	* Merged a whole bunch more stuff - debt pad is looking quite skinny now
	* Continuing to review Classic > Lite SR migration doc with Lite team
		* Including new funky diagram
	* Review and merging for UIO+ and UIO+ for Morphic, including GPII-4218 stuf
	* Meeting about unsticking capture work for 1.3.5
	* Headsup, will start to be spotty availability for a bit starting late next week as we begin the GREAT MOVE BACK

Christopher:
	* MorphicLite > MorphicLiteClientMac
		* Issue #13: Provide generic support for capture/apply using Property Lists
			* Code is already reading/writing/saving property list files using Objective-C types (NSNumber, etc.)
			* Today: finishing up Swift wrapper (using Swift types) in addition to supporting NS* types
		* Issue #14: Create Swift wrapper for System Automation ("Accessibility") API
			* Currently building a wrapper which allows Swift code to navigage and manipulate third-party UIs
			* Example uses:
				* Today: setting the "checked" state of features in System Preferences
				* Future: activating menu items (such as "zoom +") in web browsers that don't support "SendKey"
			* Because macOS resets "Accessibility" permission every time we recompile in dev mode, and because macOS 10.15 removes the "sudo tccutil" command-line option to enable Accessibility settings for an app:
				* I'm building a simple terminal app which can give our application-under-development permission to use Accessibility settings...using our Swift library
	* MorphicLite > MorphicLiteClientWindows
		* Issue #77: Obtain code signing certificate for signing Windows installer packages
			* Obtained EV Code Signing Certificate
			* Generated from, installed into Azure Key Vault (with Azure Service Connection and Azure-stored secrets)
			* Certificate expires in 3 years; signing secret password expires in 1 year
