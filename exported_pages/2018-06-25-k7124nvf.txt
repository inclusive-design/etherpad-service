Agenda:
    * Cindy's cluster: couchdb issue
    * Cindy's cluster: rolling-update issue
    * CouchDB destructive testing with Sergey's helm chart (partially done)?
	* Sergey's solution doesn't do re-sharding / doesn't sync all the data to all the nodes. Alfredo says his fork of couchdiscover handles this. Sergey is going to try latest couchdb (2.1) with Alfredo's couchdiscover fork.
    * Docker Registry outage (https://status.docker.com/pages/incident/533c6539221ae15e3f000031/5b301cb6ab905c04b1de8e95)
    * Postpone Vault integration in favor of Google KMS?
	* Yes. Sergey is continuing to investigate.
