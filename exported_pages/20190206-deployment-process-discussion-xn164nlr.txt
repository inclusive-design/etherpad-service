The issue we're discussing.

https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3661


The current process is triggered when changes are merged into universal master:

https://ci.gpii.net/view/Docker/job/docker-gpii-universal-master/

Tony argues for only having dev releases deployed to QA, and perhaps setting up a dev instance that pulls directly from master.

Javi mentioned "time line in plain language" as the process of managing a Morphic release:

Talking about two parallel processes:

1. Releasing an updated client (gpii-app, installer, etc.)
2. Updating the cloud with the associated versions of various services stored in master.

Tony proposes tying #1 to versions of gpii-app, and tying #2 to versions of universal, and managing each separately, perhaps with issue types or sub-types.

Talking about a "mesh" workflow where the issue might pass between QA, Dev, and DevOps.  The only "exit", i.e. transition to "ready to deploy" is in the QA-associate
