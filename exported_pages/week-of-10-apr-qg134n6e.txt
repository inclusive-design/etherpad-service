Alfredo: Generate collection of Vagrant boxes. Stuck in Windows 7 32-bit (BSOD during build). Will publish rest of images for use. Waiting for Steve Grundell to talk about metrics stuff. Related to backlog task GPII-2026 which relies on Prometheus client -- extend that ticket to cover current work? No, that's separate work focused more on cloud components -- Alfredo will create a separate ticket.
Tyler: Reorganizing terraform code into modules. Preparing for demo later today. No blockers.

12-Apr-2017:
Tyler: Demo on Monday, still working on modules. Not blocked. 
Gio: Finished the first iteration of the Kubernetes cluster exploration. attached results on JIRA 2317, published documentation on the GitHub repo. No blockers. 
Alfredo: Released most of the virtual boxes. Blocked on the metrics, waiting on Steve Grundell to become available (should be on 12-Apr).
