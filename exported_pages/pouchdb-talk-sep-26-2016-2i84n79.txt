	* Issues with cleanUp() changes
		* Please continue to return a promise
		* CleanUp() no longer removes the physical db files on the disk. Compacting the database does not result in smaller file sizes.  May need to reinstitute the directory cleanup based on a declarative option.
		* Restarting the pouch harnes doesn't reload the data.  This is because the old system checked only for the existance of the directory to determine if the content exists.  We need a new and better check.
		* Cindy suggests closing the db before attempting to remove the content.
		* If compacting doesn't remove any content, might as well skip that in favor of close -> delete.

	* Couch 2.0
		* http://docs.couchdb.org/en/2.0.0/api/database/find.html

Summary, CouchDB 2.0 find interface looks interesting, but no option for that in express-pouchdb.  Full text searching just another variant on what we already have, but without the option to test it.
