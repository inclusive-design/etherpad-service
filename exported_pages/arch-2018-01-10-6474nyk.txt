Steve Grundell
	- Responding to reviews
		GPII-2295: User listeners
		GPII-2751: Memory corruption
		GPII-2212: Language support.
	- GPII-2554: Locking tray icon. No longer possible
	- GPII-2772: Windows system settings handler
	- Discussed the IoD proposal

Tony:
	1. Finished up a quick spike to improve gpii-testem to better support complex repos like universal, and to more cleanly support both simple use cases (only browser tests, seamlessly instrumented and reported on) and complex use cases (code instrumented elsewhere, creating combined reports for both node and browsers).
	1. To exercise the work on gpii-testem, resumed work on the universal and infusion pulls.
		2. Infusion seems in better shape, we now have a much better report than before: http://the-t-in-rtf.github.io/coverage-reports/infusion/20180110/
		2. The universal pull is still stuck until I can figure out how to make our codebase work with nyc (or perhaps the older istanbul).  May need to review with Antranig, depending.
	1. Working on automating UL API imports as an early part of the handover of P4A work to maintenance.
	1. Will shortly begin revisiting conversations regarding the live solutions registry and some of the pieces we need (IMO) to achieve that.
