Tony:
	1. As part of the push to upgrade to a "root safe dedupe" version of infusion throughout my work, Antranig and I have been working through a murder of PRs (and I propose that as the collective term moving forward  a "tug" of pull requests?).
	1. While there, I have set up and started testing my work with the Vagrant CI plugin and GitLab.  Having the ability to consistently test in Windows 10 (and to a certain extent Windows 7) is very helpful.
	1. Where possible, also addressed security problems highlighted by snyk.
	1. To speed up long-running universal tests, updated gpii-pouchdb to force "rimraf" calls to eventually timeout.
	1. Also addressed additional cleanup concerns with gpii-pouchdb.  There are two more small PRs coming that clean up additional temp directories created by gpii-pouchdb and gpii-testem.
	1. Continued discussing JSON Schema and live registries on the mailing list.


Tyler:
    * Terraform! https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2388


AGENDA:
    
    Where does the group want me (Tony) to sketch out my proposed structure for JSON Schemas and settings?  (see mailing list)
