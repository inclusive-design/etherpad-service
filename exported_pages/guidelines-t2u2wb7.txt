Infusion
Infusion is a code framework for building personalizable and adaptive applications using JavaScript and other web technologies. The Infusion framework provides a way for developers to collaborate with designers to create open, modular, and context-aware software that can be changed and configured during use. It also includes a growing collection of user interface components, built on top of jQuery, that help make it easier to build user interfaces by mixing and matching accessible components and then customizing them to suit your unique requirements. Infusion's components are flexible; their default features, styling, and parts can be easily changed, replaced, and added to. 

Infusion provides individuals with a way to engage in the design process, too. Components such as User Interface Options and the Preferences Framework offer customization features that let users adapt an application to suit their personal needs and preferences. Using the GPII, they can carry around their preferences from application to application, and the user interface will adapt to them automatically when they log in. Infusion's declarative style of programming supports the creation of authoring tools and end-user design tools. The Infusion framework reflects an accumulation of experience about how to make applications accessible, and is as much about community values, shared inclusive practices, and documentation as it is about code and components.
