DevOps meeting
https://issues.gpii.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=19&view=planning
	* We need a process for how items should enter the backlogâ€”some way that a developer, for example, could file an issue for ops team and then it would be triaged and enter the planning process
	* 

Agenda Items
	* How is the process going so far? (Colin)
	* Swarm-related comparison tasks with Kubernetes (Colin)
		* How to measure 
		* (Initial suggestion) Compare major areas broadly:

* Revisit when Sandra is back: how do tickets (especially from "external" colleagues (GPII developer)) get into backlog?
	* Assign to "unassigned" or some other dummy to prevent confusion on what Tyler is working vs what Tyler is assigned because he is the default?
