Documentation and diagrams:
	* https://github.com/GPII/gpii-architecture-docs/pulls 
We need Javi and Kasper to take a look at this. It would be really good to get this merged.

Talk to Kasper about UIO+ settings :)

Talking about CI updates for universal (code coverage):
    https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/508
Gio will test on linux & windows
Gio will coordinate the update to the CI
CIndy will merge

Talking about yarn/npm5:
    See mailing list for background.
Tony will keep track of this and let us know when it's safe to move to it.

Onboarding flow (Ale Draft)
	* What does the onboarder need to provide with the solution?
	* What's the review process like?
	* How do we get test versions of the software getting onboarded?
	* How do we go about periodical testing?
	* What can we do to help support automated testing? (e.g. some kind of "mega AT" virtual machine that contains every application that we support)
		* how would we manage licenses for this? would we need some kind of special CI-only process and buy licenses just for that VM, or could developers use this VM on their computers?

Next steps for multi-server CI environment setups
	* Our currently failing "canary in the mine" pull request https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/510
		* Giovanni comment: https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/510#issuecomment-310130663
	* GPII-2411, GPII-2103, and more
	* Background information on why this is stuck:
		* Kasper's PR depends on a new preference set (mike|Vargas) that doesn't exist in the master branch
		* The tests depend on external services (preferences.gpii.net) and they are spin up from the master branch
		* We need better end-to-end tests that spin up an environment and point the tests to the right location (in other words, the tests need to run against an instance of Preferences server that was conjured from the same branch)
		* Another issues is that some tests are hard-coded to point to 'localhost' and that created a conflict with a separate Preferences server we wanted to spin up locally (see gist below)
		* This last issue (hardcoded localhost) could in theory be solved with the new work merged into fluid-project/kettle/pull/33 and modification to the GPII config files
		* Work done on the F2F to get this running (and then we got stuck with the hardcoded localhost tests) https://gist.github.com/gtirloni/eb38a8a031efea5e610ff12d31f52c0b
