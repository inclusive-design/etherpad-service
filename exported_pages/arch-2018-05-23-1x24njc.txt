STeve grundell:
    IoD

Tony:

	* Continued working on the GSS (GPII Schema System) spike, will roll that into a new candidate release of gpii-json-schema in the next week and change.  Already have a working approach for:
			* our metaschema
			* schema-validated components that refuse to start up if their options are wrong.
			* schema-validated modelComponents
			* Our "UI" overlay which allows defining custom error messages and UI hints within the schema.
			* Internationalisation/Localisation of validation output. 
	* Worked with Antranig to figure out the last problems with the (now merged) gpii-app pull.
	* Continued meeting with Simon, Antranig, (minus Cindy this week) regarding auth and other issues.
	* Figured out how to create a "scoped" fork of gpii-express to let us use newer versions of the vendor's codebase, which is in a monorepo.  Should result in a release of gpii-pouchdb with much more modern dependencies.

Tyler:
    * Finished estimating backlog
    * Deployed Cindy's PR
    * AWS-to-GKE

Windows 10 S Notes:

	* https://support.microsoft.com/en-ca/help/4020089/windows-10-in-s-mode-faq
	* "Windows 10 in S mode" is Microsoft's new language
	* Initially Windows 10 S was a separate verson of Windows
	* Now it's being presented as a mode
	* So, Windows 10 Home, Pro, or Enterprise could each be run in "S mode"
	* "With the release of Windows 10, the April 2018 Update, 'Windows 10 S' becomes a mode of Windows 10 (called 'S mode') that is available in more editions of Windows (not just Windows 10 Pro). You’ll be able to buy new PCs with either Windows 10 Home in S mode or Windows 10 Pro in S mode preinstalled. If you have an existing Windows 10 S device, when you install the April 2018 Update, the device will become a Windows 10 Pro in S mode device."
