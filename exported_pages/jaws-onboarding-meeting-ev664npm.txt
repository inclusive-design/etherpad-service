JAWS Onboarding Stuff

we started looking at the Jaws pull request and it includes a lot of settings that was previously not implemented due to one or more of:
	* Not knowing what the value range is (e.g. integers where we're unaware of min and max, strings that we dont know values of, etc)
	* Not knowing the defaults
	* The settings are obscure

These things are all issues wrt to the capture tool and in consideration of which and how to restore them.

There are some important features in JJs branch that are important for the capture functionality, such as finding an reading the active profile used in jaws (using the settings there).


We will comment out settings from JJ's JAWS pulls that:
    a) Do not have default values
    b) Do not have reasonable bounds for their value space.
    
This will be to ensure that - AKA plan of action:
	* Tony will submit a small PR against githens branch (which will add a validation tweak which will highlight the settings that fails the above requirements) - https://github.com/sgithens/universal/pull/3
	* Hens can see the failed settings by running this: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/e603edca362df591f76445d8d2b0406b81ca7c74/gpii/node_modules/solutionsRegistry/test/SolutionsRegistryFileTests.js#L1
	* Hens will remove the settings in question and update his PR
