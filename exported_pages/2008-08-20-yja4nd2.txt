Agenda:
    
- GCP CI testing strategy -> ops weekly
  - Wait for CI Volumes to be merged
  - Merge master (including CI Volume) into GPII-3125 locally
  - Create a common/stg directory with the test organization as a parameter
  - Test locally using shared Test organisation (stg)
  - Push local branch (GPII-3125 + master) to master
  - Add CI steps to test common part of GCP infrastructure on stg (Test organization)
  - Add CI steps to apply common part on prd


Separate task from previous:
  - Integrate unique IDs code


Planning
* Alfredo wants all his tasks in one backlog (even for things that aren't strictly related to the ops team at large)
* Closed some old tickets, re-prioritzed some tickets
* Alfredo will be point person on IDRC Migration and associated tasks
	* Will ask for help on certain issues on a case-by-case basis, especially on things that are cross-cutting (e.g. maintaining a separate k8s cluster for Gregg's random projects, the CI Worker)
