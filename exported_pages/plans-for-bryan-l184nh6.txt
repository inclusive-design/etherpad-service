Bryan has set up his dev environment, and checked out all the major projects and run their tests ok.

The structure is gpii-app -> gpii-windows -> gpii-universal
                               ^
                       Astea's work is mostly there
                       
Very top-level structure: This config file and its friends:
    https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/blob/master/configs/app.base.json
    
This is a "config" whose packaging is read by another library, Kettle: ;https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle
Fine-level detail: Config loader is in this file: https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle/blob/master/lib/KettleConfigLoader.js

On this line, it brings in the whole rest of the architecture via this include: https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/blob/master/configs/app.base.json#L25

On this line, it defines the base grade for the entire App and "distributes" it deep into the architecture: https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/blob/master/configs/app.base.json#L7

The main driver: https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/blob/master/index.js

The main app is in here! https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/blob/master/src/main/app.js

The appWrapper is here: https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/blob/master/src/main/app.js#L595

Defines the app as a subcomponent so that its definitions are not plastered onto the main architecture via grade composition

The app itself

https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/blob/master/src/main/app.js#L62

Many of these definitions here: https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/blob/master/src/main/app.js#L344
represent direct function call coupling with the core architecture

The main (official) source of communication/IPC between the UI and the core process: 
    https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/blob/master/src/main/app.js#L134
    
Definition of that: https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/blob/master/src/main/gpiiConnector.js

A schema for all of the JSON messages that slosh over this bus can be inspected in this JSDoc comments: 
    https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/blob/master/src/main/gpiiConnector.js#L401

A probably hugely out of date client sketch for what goes over this bus is in the main architecture at https://github.com/GPII/universal/tree/master/examples/pspChannelClient

Major upcoming work described in this doc:
    https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cG4jErACrPJxBNBzK2RDLPsvTdlxNJjPiYp684JubFk/edit?ts=5bcf5f0a
    Currently under discussion re. security/authentication/UX requirements
    
Another important thing that the app does is field these surveys to users:
    https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/tree/master/src/main/surveys
    These are fielded to a UI hosted by a "Qualtrix" survey system on Gregg's institution at UMD
    


Perhaps dusting off this very nearly finished pull of JJs' might be a good "first task"

https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/611

i) clone the core arch repo
ii) make your own fork and add it as a remote
iii) add JJ's fork as another remote and check out his branch locally
iv) push the branch to the same-named branch in your own repo
v) finish off the pull
vi) close JJ's pull and add your own variant of it, with a comment pointing back to the original pull
vii) ping us for review!
