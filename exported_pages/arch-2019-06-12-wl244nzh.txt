GPII Architecture Meeting Minutes, June 12, 2019.


UPDATES:

Javi
	* Biorhythms are almost back to the timezone
	* Had some follow ups with different people about the f2f
	* Had a technical interview with a candidate
	* Been taking a look/providing feedback to a document for the Smartwork EU funded project

Antranig:
	* Working with ADTKINS on solutions registry reorganisation
	* Writing more documentation
	* Meetings with HA about new functionality - "PSP replacement" 
		* Descoped this slightly since the wireframes refer to functionality (icons/colours for prefs sets) that are not on our current critical path
		* This includes the UI for authenticating to a safe via login/password
		* There will need to be a further round of UX thought about what happens when a site running autologon (e.g. Nova) gets logged out, or logs in by some other means

Cindy
	* GPII-3717: Nova implementation
		* Finished the work on /access_token request handler
		* In progress on verifying client's privileges of creating GPII keys and prefs safes
	* Merged Joseph's universal pull request that deletes expired access tokens(that no longer archives anything; just deletes the expired access tokens)

Joseph:
	* APCP face-to-face meeting
	* GPII-3646: Remove expired access tokens (universal)
		* Cindy merged into master (YAYYYY!!)
		* JIRA still open -- should it be closed? just closed it. thanks for the reminder
		* https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3646
	* GPII-3333: Kubernetes cronjob to run the expired access tokens removal peridocially, aka "flushtokens" (gpii-infra)
		* Updated pull request for deployment process to use the "latest" universal in GCP staging/production
			* https://github.com/gpii-ops/gpii-infra/pull/383
		* Working on modifying yaml for cronjob to kill the associated istio side car container when flushtokens container completes
			* Using "lifecycle" section to implement shutdown of istio sidecar as demonstrated last week using the command line
			* But, doesn't appear to do anything:  sidecar still running, and no errors.
			* Will discuss with ops team in slack
			* Just found github issue about lifecycle; will digest:  https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/55807

Sandra:
 - Update from Pilots: 
      - Gregg hired a student, Matt Reyes, to provide onsite support at NOVA during the summer. He'll also help Maureen support AJC3. 
	-  He also hired Rachel Woods to establish a support structure. He'll introduce her to the team at some point. 
	- Update on NOVA: next week itâ€™s going to be promoted for the first time, several tables will be set up in the library, in the Parish Hall lobby and in the open lab, introducing Morphic to students, giving them swag. Daune will be doing a little bit of training of Matt. Student interns will be helping. 
	- Update on Broad Rock library: They are all installed, and everything seems to be working. There is evidence Morphic is being used.
	- Update on Chicasaw library:  All 46 computers have been installed. No issues reported so far.
	- Update on AJC3: Maureen has detected many inconsistencies with the languages. Steve Grundell checked, and his fix was not applied. Matt is going to uninstall all (10) and reinstall them. 
- Working on my take-aways from Toronto: 1. Writing the Improvements from the post-mortem into actionable tasks and 2. Writing a plan for Individual Installation. 
- I'm taking this afternoon off, maybe Friday afternoon also.  - Enjoy your days off ;)


Kavya
	* Working on 1.2 Testplan document

and languages and do clean install
