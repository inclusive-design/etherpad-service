	* snow-theme was manually (copied or cloned) from the big-idea-theme


	1. ideally, we would create a base theme repository that represents the "starting point" for any new IDRC Wordpress site:
		* this would involve some work paring back the big-idea-theme snow-theme to remove its  branding, etc.
			* e.g. remove background images
			* replace BI branding with placeholder images such as masthead, logo, etc. (which are designed to prompt users of the theme to replace them with their own?)
			* need to refactor the big idea stuff from the parent theme
				* anything common across big idea and snow should stay
				* anything not common should be moved into either the big idea or the snow theme
					* Example: https://github.com/jhung/wp-a11y-theme/tree/foundation/images
					* also some PHP code, but Jon will need to crawl the code and find it
		* gut feel estimate is probably about 3 weeks to do so
	1. a lot of these themes are in personal github spaces, and should be moved to the inclusive-design (or maybe fluid-project) org
		* wp-a11y-theme (lives in jhung right now?) -> move to fluid-project org IDI
		* big-idea-theme (lives in jhung) -> move to inclusive-design org
		* snow-theme (lives in grrrerro) -> move to inclusive-design org
		* big idea feedback plugin (lives in jhung) -> needs to be generalized before it can be used in other sites, then migrated to inclusive-design
		* UIO wordpress plugin lives in fluid-project already (yay!)
			* might need some updates to work with the very latest UIO, but it's relatively up to date
			* should come up with a simple release process -> upgrading version numbers, tagging
			* we don't currently publish this plugin to the larger wordpress.org repository -> should consider if we want to do this, or if it should be more informal
		* there are some code quality issues with some of these repositories, but can we move them anyway?
			* Document issues and todos, file Jiras as needed
			* and then let's just move 'em!
			* question of governance: who gets to review, who's allowed to push directly?
				* for now, let's keep it super informal:
					* every change gets submitted as a PR
					* contributors ask for review whenever they can
					* submitters can push directly if needed
			* everything except the uio-plugin will move to the inclusive-design org
	1. wp-a11y-theme improvements
		* we have A BRANCHâ€”the Foundation branch
			* it should be merged into master and users should start to use it (LET'S DO IT!)




Next Steps:
    
    Jon will plan 1.
    2. will be done soon->let's pick a free afternoon and just do it
    3. we will form a team for the IDRC site
	    another design iteration emphasizing resources and learning about inclusive design
          improving themes and workflows for our WP sites prior to starting full implementation
          colin will talk to vera about lisa's availability
          team of (hopefully) lisa, jon, eloisa to do the idrc site redesign-build
