* Brendan joins us to talk about operational security of GPII
** Lots of compliance regs to worry about (NIST 800-37 (Risk management), NIST 800-53 (security controls), FedRAMP (NIST 800-37/53 plus a massive audit burden), HIPAA, HITECH (HIPAA Strikes Back), FERPA, etc.)
** Reproducible cluster deployment (gpii-terraform is where this work is happening)
** Vault is probably useful in our future (replacing manual key management, improve SSL cert management)
** Centralized logging, ElasticSearch

* End of Sprint 7
	* Sprint never started? Reports are weird; closed tickets went down to Sprint 6. Sandra will investigate.
* For Sprint 8:
    * Follow up to 2464 that Gio will write -https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2563
    * 2543 (SSL) to continue Gio's work
    * 2542 (better docker image version management)
    * 2544 (couchdb replication)
    * Anyone who finishes early can help with couchdb or look at ebs backup/restore (2545)
