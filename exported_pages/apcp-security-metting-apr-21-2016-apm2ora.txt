Agenda:
	* IBM team to discuss the security gaps that we've identified based on last week's discussions

Feedback and clarifications:
	* #1: Be able to trace each requirement to a link of which standard/doc that brings up the requirement; be precise of what needs to be logged based on what's defined in the standards
	* #2: Evaluate the store of what kind of data that leads GPII to FISMA high (level 3).
	* #3: database credentials: the crendentials used by GPII application to access databases
	* #5: Open to evaluate other framework and protocols other than OAuth2 for protection
