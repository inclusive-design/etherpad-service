Joseph
	* IDRC Christmas party -- will give update on the pad, but then drop off call.
	* Worked on GPII-2673, where npm 5.x install wipes out "..node_modules/universal/gpii/node_modules/" folder
		* Replicated with the GPII linux master branch.
		* But, properlay installed the universal's gpii node_modules with one of my branches
		* Looking for the difference, but nothing obvious so far
		* See details in comment on JIRA: https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2673?focusedCommentId=29905&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-29905

Tony:
	* Put "updates" (diff) reports for the UL in production.
	* Revisited open pulls against infusion, linux, windows, and universal with an eye to unsticking them.
		* The linux pull should be ready for review.
		* For the windows pull, I figured out a working configuration of "nyc" that now seems to be working.  Unfortunately there are now unique failures in CI that I can't reproduce.
		* Also updated infusion to use nyc for instrumentation and fixed various sources of instability.  Currently working on some really odd instability issues in running the tests.  In both OS X and Windows, there are a varying number of tests run in successive successful test runs.  The linux VM has unique failures, but reports the same number of tests run in all runs.
		* The universal pull will need to be updated once I confirm that my new approach with windows and infusion is viable there (may require new components in the gpii-testem package, depending).
	* Will shortly be discussing with Colin, Antranig, Gregg, and Sandra the live solutions registry and my role in the larger project post-P4A.

Tyler:
    * Alerting and notifications with alertmanager

	* Working on Survey Pop-up Functionality:
		* Created tasks based on the finalized breakdown, they can be seen in this board: https://issues.gpii.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=23
		* GPII-2759, 2760: integrated a web survey into a PSP popup and working on handling actions within the content that have results outside of the survey
		* GPII-2763: working on communication between the PSP client and the server, currently have a locally set up server
		* GPII-2758: detecting elapsed time since key in and planning on supporting other triggers in the future. 
		* GPII-2762, 2764: working on styling the popup and on the UX of the popup
	* Reviewed Kasperâ€™s PR on removing support for the previous API format. It looked good to the team
