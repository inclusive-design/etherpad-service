	* stegru
    
    Continue conversation about improved enactors for UIO in the Chrome extention (Cindy)
	* where is the proper location on the web page for the table of content enactor to insert the container for rendering the toc
		* Possiibly:  If the page uses a <main> element (or a role="main"), use that element as the basis for the ToC.
			* the <main> is to desiignate the mian content of the page, not all the stuff around the it; not the banners, not the breadcrumbs, etc.
		* Create a mapping table to map urls with their main content containers identified by css selectors or ids etc
		* Javi points out an existing table of content chrome extension: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/table-of-contents-crx/eeknhipceeelbgdbcmchicoaoalfdnhi?hl=en
			* It doesn't work well with some websites but works with others
			* It needs user interaction to trigger the show/hide of toc
