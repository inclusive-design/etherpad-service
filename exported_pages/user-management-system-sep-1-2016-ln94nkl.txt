    Comment moderation, managementt & tooling to do so - v. important

    https://shibboleth.net/
    OpenAM  -> https://backstage.forgerock.com/#!/docs/openam/13.5/getting-started (that's the one SILO is using)

Current GPII OAuth2 implementation with supported grant types: https://wiki.gpii.net/w/GPII_OAuth_2_Guide

Need to gather information about use cases throughout the GPII as well.

Need to document the use cases for both the SAA and the User Review Widget.  Assistance on Demand (uses OpenAM).  Developer Space has talked about associating with a third-party account (github, etc.).
