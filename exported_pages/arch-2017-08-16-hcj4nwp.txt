Tyler:
    * Planning and estimating cloud support for Sticky PCP 
    *  Stapling GPII components to Terraform/Kops infrastructure

AGENDA:
    * Ops on GPII in the cloud for Sticky PCP -- end-to-end tests
	* Messy notes with some background/context: https://pad.gpii.net/p/2017-08-15-3ke4nn8 <---- that link is extremely hard to see fixed :)
	* "production tests" are merged to master
	https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/530
	http://lists.gpii.net/pipermail/architecture/2017-August/004627.html
	* Antranig believes these tests can be pointed to public cloud components. If these tests pass, we have confidence that public cloud-based components are working correctly.
		* However - in a future deployment of the GPII and preferences infrastructure, for example, once the "PCP with memory" goes into production, our live preferences server will not hold simply test preferences, but live user data, and there will be different requirements on these so-called "production verification tests" (which may well run periodically and repeatedly as a running health check of the system)
		* Tests need modification to point to public cloud
		* Must not rely on existing preferences in preferences server (unless we decide that the contents of certain snapsets will continue to be hosted in the cloud in this way)
		* Must be non-destructive
