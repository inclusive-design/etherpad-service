Onboarding flow (Ale Draft)
	* What does the onboarder need to provide with the solution?
	* What's the review process like?
	* How do we get test versions of the software getting onboarded?
	* How do we go about periodical testing?
	* What can we do to help support automated testing? (e.g. some kind of "mega AT" virtual machine that contains every application that we support)
		* how would we manage licenses for this? would we need some kind of special CI-only process and buy licenses just for that VM, or could developers use this VM on their computers?

Next steps for multi-server CI environment setups
	* https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/510
	* GPII-2411, GPII-2103, and more
