    "Anyone who is competent of doing cluster development can and should have access"
	    developers who are responsible for production need sufficient access for doing things in production
	Decision: do nothing right now
	Decision: meet in the next week or two (Colin, Tyler, Brendan, Alfredo, anyone else?) to talk about longer-term strategies
	
    
    
    Alfredo proposed, for his Preferneces Server clustering work (which is currently under way):
	* "finishing my work on clustering"
	* release a "pretty sable" cluster
	* file a JIRA about introducing haproxy in order to deal with load balancing cases where Kubernetes' iptables strategy will redirect to a dead instance
	* move on to high priority logging issues
        
System administration tasks:
	* Fix the update of SSL certificates
		* *.gpii.net -- which ones?
	* Fix CI when it breaks, for example, when tasks get stuck or fail do to server issues
	* Add features to the CI
	* Trigger CI jobs
	* Mediawiki issues
	* Jira issues
	* Upgrade common applications
	* Update testing VMs
	* Security updates

Should we have a brief agenda item for each week?: "What tasks did you do this week that weren't in the plan or in the backlog?" -> for anything we identify here, we need to create JIRAs and add them to the plan
