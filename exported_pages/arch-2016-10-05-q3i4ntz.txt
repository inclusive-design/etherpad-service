	* Reviewing pull requests
	* Plan to work on data loaders (https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-1987)

Javi
	* Several meetings

	* Kept working on https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2046 - will ping Kasper and potentially Antranig to clarify a few things
	* re PCP, we met yesterday and I've been going through the PCP wireframes again and see (based on the meeting) if there are things that need to be clarified before keep going with PCP/API

Joseph
	* GPII-1839:  use the dynamic device reporter when running acceptance tests:
		* added a graceful way to handle writing a settings INI file that does not exist.
		* still, the jqUnit tests with settings still fail (since the solution isn't installed, and there are no settings...).  Looking for a way to handle this (infusion's context awareness?)
		* pinged Kasper about some of his comments on my pull request.
	* GPII-1838: Some unit tests fail with running them from a host machine on a vagrant VM ('vagrant ssh -c ...').
		* Using Alfredo's patch and testing to see if it solve the problem (https://github.com/idi-ops/packer-fedora/pull/8)
		* looks good so far, but I haven't completed my testing.
		* problem with ssh keys when doing 'vagrant up' (https://github.com/idi-ops/packer-fedora/pull/8#issuecomment-251716792)
	* Updated status of my pull requests for Sandra.

Kavya

	* Done HW sensitivity testcases for UX team
	* Done initial smoke tests on installer - found some bugs - need to check with kasper

	* Reviewing pull requests for GPII and Infusion
	* Merged in Antranig's journaling work
	* Preparing for upcoming P4A meeting and working on discovery for Nexus

Steve Grundell

	* Neglected GPII-81
