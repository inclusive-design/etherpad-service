GPII Architecture Meeting Minutes, October 30, 2019.

UPDATES:

Javi
	* The windows vagrant box was updated two weeks ago - along with changes on windows and gpii-app - merge with master
	* Continued working on node12/electron6 update - https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-4140
		* Created repos for deps and PRs
			* https://github.com/GPII/ref/pull/1
			* https://github.com/GPII/ref-struct/pull/1
			* https://github.com/GPII/ref-array/pull/1
			* https://github.com/GPII/node-pcsclite/pull/1
		* We still need to figure out what's going on on electron 6 (blank window)
	* I created an installer (1.2.3) that is now under testing and supposed to be deployed at chickasaw
	* Supported Matt in troubleshooting an error at NOVA
	* I have been trying to reproduce the problem reported at the Prince William Job Center about Morphic interfering with eTests (https://www.casas.org/product-overviews/software/casas-etests)
	* Meetings with different people/teams about different topics

Alfredo:
	* GPII-2951 - Deployed the changes that allows the migration from AWS to GCP (sadly we had some minutes of outage)
	* GPII-3718 - Tunning some alerts to be more precise
	* Messing with morphic.org domain due to Gregg's request this weekend

Christopher
    - Morphic for macOS
        - Wrapped display (screen resolution, "Screen Zoom") native Swift code in C APIs (to bridge from node-ffi-napi)
        - Created “System Preferences” links to match corresponding new feature in Morphic for Windows
            - Started conversation with Antranig and Steve G; we need to create universal tags which can map to control panel/preference panes on an OS-specific (and OS version-specific) basis
            - Option #1 (now): system URLs (e.g. "x-apple.systempreferences:com.apple.preference.security”)
            - Option #2 (now): shell launch via direct path (e.g. /System/Library/PreferencePanes/Security.prefPane)
            - Option #3 (future): use AppleScript bridge or automation APIs; this will also allow us to select individual sub-panes (such as selecting “Accessibility” within the “Privacy” tab of the “Security & Privacy” preferences pane)
            - NOTE: the "open System Preferences" feature is designed to be used in two scenarios: (a) Build Your Own Button; (b) to re-prompt user for permissions as appropriate/possible
        - Continuing refactoring efforts (working towards a cross-platform gpii-app)
   - macOS API Test Mule
        - Implemented system URL (option #1) and shell launch (option #2) features, as an easy test bed for new URLs
        - Wrote documentation (currently inside test mule source) on how to discover the system URLs and file (shell) paths for System Preferences panes

Cindy
	* GPII-3958: Implement the new PSPChannel read API
		* In progress
	* Meetings and discussions about database alternatives

JJ:
	* Addressing issues found by Antranig in pull GPII-3810.
	* Keep working into GPII-4152.
	* Some minor work into failing pull GPII-4183, received feeback from Tony, I need to update with it.

Joseph:
	* Update to latest windows box
	* GPII-3832:  Run production tests in the cloud (GCP)
		* waiting in queue
		* https://github.com/gpii-ops/gpii-infra/pull/347
	* GPII-3117: Remove the environment reporter and adjust the ContextManager as appropriate
		* As per last week's discussion and resolution,
			* removed code that handled "conditions" blocks in preferences, and
			* removed actual "conditions" blocks from anywhere within the universal repository
		* Issued a pull request: https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/823
		* Responded to review comments
		* Next step is to remove the ContextManager entirely, and migrate what little functionality remains to the LIfecycleManager
		* Working on a new test failure
