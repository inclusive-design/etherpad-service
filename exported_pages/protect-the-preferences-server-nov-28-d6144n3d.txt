GPII authorization workflow diagrams: https://wiki.gpii.net/w/GPII_Authorization_Workflows

Things in diagrams to improve:
Diagram 1: 
	* Split into 3 parts:
		* remote web server hosting the integrated web application
		* user's local machine running web browser
		* GPII cloud (what we already have in the diagram on the right with the auth server, perferences server, and so on)
	* details for the login process - retrieve and verify user id/pwd from the OAuth2 data store
	* remove the vertical line in btw step 13 and 14
	* 4 parellel processings on 7 - 14
Diagram 2:
	* remove the vertical line in btw step 6 and 7
	* 4 parellel processings on 2 - 7
Diagram 3:
	* Missing step 3, which should be step 4
	* The filtering and matchmaking process also happens with the local flow manger in this diagram. confirmed which one, diagram 1 or 2, is more likely the equivalent

Questions
1. Where to save the source graffle files
Answer: github repo: gpii-diagrams
	
Tony said: just looking, lucidchart is cross platform and supports omnigraffle import. lucidchart has a free lite version. if we mention that in the README, it's less important to author an open format.

Authorizations to think about:
	* use case 2: No verification on client.
	* use case 3: The client id is saved in the unsecured web appliation client code
