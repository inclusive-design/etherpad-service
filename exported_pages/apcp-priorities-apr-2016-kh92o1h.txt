Core 1 Content (or Minimal Functional Set) Deliverable on 31-Jul-2016

Item 1. Easy to install
	* Installer enhancements (SILO - in progress)
	* Native application wrapper for starting all appropriate GPII components  (possible: Javi, Alejandro, Githens)
		* task tray icon so you can see that it is running and see its status (using Atom Electron) (final version of this requires designs)
			* Needs to be productionized (ie. tests) and moved to GPII organization on github
			* Get plumbing in place for launching, killing and getting status (ie. running, not running, current user) for the GPII framework
		* context menu for selecting demonstration personas easily (developer builds only) (requires designs)
			* Create the NP sets for the demo personas  (depends on the essential AT list below) (anyone could make sets)
			* Get plumbing in place for logging out (and in) users
		* Designs and UX implementation 
			* Designs should be created (UX TEAM)
			* Designs should be implemented (including any extra backend work resulting from this)

Item 2. Can appropriately configure a computer that is running different AT
	* Basic, working Canopy Matchmaker (KASPER - in progress) 
		* Set the canopy matchmaker to be the default matchmaker of the system (GPII-403)
		* The valueMapper transform should be invertable and clearer semantics (GPII-1753)
		* The matchmaker should support inverse transformations (GPII-1751)
		* Ensure that input paths are correctly collected in the model transform functions (GPII-1752)
	* Supports a variety of “essential” AT (Alejandro and Sandra - in progress)
		* Decide what we consider essential ATs (and essential built-in OS features)
			* Including which settings are essential for each
			* Once done, these should be broken out into specific tasks and assigned and prioritized
		* Add support for the essential AT (IBM or other subcontractors, or anyone from the GPII team)
			* Including deciding common terms 

Item 3. Agile development – Quality Infrastructure (ALFREDO - with support from AVTAR)
	* Test automation and continuous integration
	* Docker container automated provisioning/deployment (for testing/staging)
	* Continuous, automated builds of the Installer

Item 4. Won’t “damage” a user’s system if errors occur
	* Settings journaling so that we can roll back in failure cases and compare system state to journal on restart of a crashed flow manager
		* Basic journaling and restoration support using our current settingshandler implementations (ANTRANIG - in progress)
		* Improve each settingshandler to split up the get and set process (depends on the basic journaling support) (possible: Antranig, Kasper, Javi)
	* using process detection/stopping applications as part of the configuration/restoration (possible: Antranig, Kasper, Javi, Joseph)
		* Detecting any running applications on startup, and ensuring that they're running on logout
		* Enhance the MM to actively close any conflicting applications
	* Ensuring that an application is started/stopped when we request it: (potentially Joseph, alternatively Javi, kasper, antranig)
		* Currently we dont attempt to detect whether we were actually successful in starting/stopping processes. This feature would be helpful both when restoring and configuring the system 
		* This would also be helpful for writing/running cleaner acceptance tests.
	* Windows issue with theme and mouse cursor being set simutaneously (Dipesh - In progress or similar windows developer)

Item 5. Comprehensive Advanced Preferences Management Tool (CAPMT)
	* Basic interface for the development teams to be able to edit any preference on anything that works with GPII preferences  
		* Reads data in from the solutions registry and presents (all of)  it to the person creating or editing a preference set.
			* Link the CA-PMT to the preference terms dictionary (common terms registry) and the solutions registry
				* Ensure that PTD and UL (or solutions registry) has an API to get the desired data (possible: Tony Atkins?)
		* Design and UX implementation:
			* Designs should be made (and UX decided)  (UX TEAM)
				* If creating a preference set - all settings are default
				* If editing a preference set -- the preferences from that preference set would override the default
				* In both cases saving changes / creates the pref set.
			* Designs should be implemented (potentially someone subcontracted for this task, alfredo, IDRC) (requires designs)
	* Configure the CAPMT according to the user settings
		* Fix up the C4A browser plugin (probably for Firefox and Chrome both) for linking the installed GPII with web-page content. (Javi - in progress)
		* Ensure that UIOptions are able to retrieve settings from the plugin. (possible Javi, Alfredo, ???)
		* Matchmaker should provide settings for webpages (either by default or on-demand) (possible Kasper, Javi) - Blocked: requires group discussion

Item 6. Personal Control Panel
	* The PCP, or personal control panel, is a small panel of controls that is customized by each individual to meet their needs.
		* Design and UX should be made (UX TEAM)
		* Implementation of backend support for PCP (possible javi, kasper, subcontract)
		* Implementation of UI of the PCP (potentially someone subcontracted for this task, alfredo, IDRC)

Item 7. GPII User Access
	* Account setup
		* Designs and UX flow planned (UX TEAM)
		* First pass at backend aspects of security/privacy implementation (cindy and IBM)
		* Implementation of UX designs (cindy)
	* Provision a NFC tag
		* Have cross-platform standardized API for writing/reading tags, detecting NFC availability (full team decision/discussion)
		* Implement NFC tag reader and writer in Windows (and update linux one) (Dipesh or Steve Lee for windows, Javi or Steve Githens for Linux)
		* Implement interface between Flowmanager/PCP/PMT for writing tags (possible: Javi, Kasper Antranig, Githens)
