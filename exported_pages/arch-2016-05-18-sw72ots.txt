Tony:
	1. Working on the new search API for the UL..
		2. The new code uses "new world" approaches like gpii-express, gpii-handlebars, gpii-json-schema, and kettle dataSources.
		2. Should have feature parity with the read portions of the UL API by the end of next week, and will then move on to the "write" portions.  Need to work with Antranig on the "asymmetric" dataSource that should help with this.
		2. To make this work, I needed to create a "URL encoding" dataSource that converts a JSON payload using qs and adds it to the query string:   https://github.com/the-t-in-rtf/gpii-couch-cushion/blob/GPII-1253/src/js/urlEncodedJsonReader.js
		2. I also took a few minutes to revisit the many variations in mapping "relationships" in couch (in the UL, we need to represent "source" records that are associated with a "unified" record).  The updated API will not use the new "relationship documents" Antranig and I discussed at the Eythorne summit of 2016.  Instead, we will need to continue getting all related records and grouping them in Javascript, which IMO is the best we can do until after June.
	1. Also working in parallel with Antranig on the kettle/infusion features I need and on the gpii-pouchdb improvements he needs to test the kettle CouchDB dataSources.
	1. Hopefully close to an initial release of gpii-express, which will hopefully also lead to initial releases of a bunch of other libraries that depend on it.
	1. Looking forward to "dogfooding" our QI infrastructure with gpii-binder as soon as Avtar sends details on adding the configuration file to my repo, et cetera.


GIANT PULL ACTION ITEMS:
	* Colin will merge in the fluid require pull request
	* Simon will look at the Kettle and see if it's ready to go in
	* Alfredo will discuss with antranig following this meeting in the channel
