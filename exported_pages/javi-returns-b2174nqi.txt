Notes for Javi


High-contrast
-------------

Fixed the problem where the wallpaper always gets reset to the default in reset to standard.
The fix is in https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/276 
It's been released, but not good enough for master (had to hack windows.rm to do nothing, due it being called by the SR).

I think high-contrast needs a rewrite: https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-4097


Auto-login
----------

At chickasaw, people logged in using their library card - but it was the same Windows account.

See https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-4099

I've put the following things into siteconfig:
- The blacklisted users (it was hardcoded)
- A location where the current user id

    autoLogin: {
        blockedUsers: ["admin*", "guest*", "student*", "visitor*", "volunteer*"],
        userIdSource: "reg:HKLM/SOFTWARE/MYPC3/Service/Username"
    }

(and updated the chickasaw siteconfig msi)
