Tony:
	1. Started onboarding 50+ new JAWS settings from Google Sheets / JAWS Docs.
	1. Reviewed and discussed that work with Antranig, Steve and Cindy, to reconcile the short term goals with the medium-to-long term registry/schema improvements we discussed in Toronto.
	1. Wrote a grunt "lint all" plugin that standardises the combined use of all the Javascript, JSON(5) and markdown checks we use.  More on that after the updates.
	1. Wrote up my initial experiences with GitLab for the group.
	1. Tried out other services comparable to GitLab (BitBucket Pipes)
	1. Will be talking with Gio on Friday to get more info about the current state of Jenkins in preparation for a discussion here next week.

Tyler:
    * Interviews
    * Debugging dev cluster problems with cindyli. We figured out why she couldn't create a cluster from her work laptop, but the investigation unearthed a bunch of weird stuff that we're still debugging (GPII-3103)

AGENDA

"lint all" plugin, which standardises checks for:
	1. Code linting based on our common ESLint configuration.
	1. JSDocs linting
	1. Markdown linting, as used in infusion-docs and with various README and package-specific docs.
	1. Linting of code blocks within markdown, including JSON and Javascript examples.
	1. checks for JSON/JSON5 validity.
	1. Linting of JSON/JSON5 content for indentation, trailing commas, et cetera.
	1. Adds checking for trailing line spaces. (That will be beautiful)

What's the crack(deal) with the JSDocs?  Happy to discuss.
It was good crack

Celebrating newest COMITER(TM) - Stegru!

Considering handling bad settings from users as errors. As Steve detected, now Phil demo user is failing in master branch, the fix should be the following:
	from:                     "http://registry.gpii.net/common/slowKeysEnable": true,
	to:                     "http://registry.gpii.net/common/slowKeys/enabled": true,
This change was introduced to master without triggering any 'acceptanceTests'. We should talk about how to prevent that situation.

We already have a couple of JIRAs open for this:
    https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-1049
    https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3009
    https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-502
    DO IT, DIPPLOTACKSIS!
