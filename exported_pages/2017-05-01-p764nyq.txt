Agenda items:
	* We need a process for how items should enter the backlogâ€”some way that a developer, for example, could file an issue for ops team and then it would be triaged and enter the planning process (from previous meeting)
		* A proposal could be:
		* Process should apply to all tickets (i.e., regardless of their shource)
			3. Assign the issue to the "Triage user" with cc to the operators involved. Need to workout the logistics. We'd like for the triage user id to be the default. 
			3. Triage the issue. Who? DevOps team and Colin
			3. Set the story points by the opers involved Goal is to do the estimation during the triage. There will be cases where they will have to be taken offline. 
			3. The PO should set the priority of the issue, Colin sets the priority with input from the team. 
			3. Inject the issue in the backlog. Sandra does this. 

	* When to hold next sprint planning meeting, which is scheduled for next week while we're in Toronto. Team agreed to push out the planning meeting to week of 15-May. 
	* Tyler: demo for this week, Colin suggested it's done next week with the team on site.
