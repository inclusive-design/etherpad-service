Notes from TJ's visit: 

Design Cards
	* suggested we do the design cards excercise at the grantees meeting.
		* check with Jutta/TJ about how they want to use the cards
		* fleshing out activities
	* expanding to encompass content creators
		* perhaps a "How to Use These Guidelines" page that highlights particular principles/practices/tools/activities for various audiences
	* Who are "content creators"?
	* Create example uses of Guide. Example: how a musician / teacher / etc might use it.
		* Would these be cards themselves?
	* Retire old design handbook: https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Design+Handbook
	* Link the printed version and the website. We should have a single source of data for both outputs. 
	* Link to printable PDF to site
		* there are 2 version: one for Duplex printing, and one for screen viewing.
	* Depending on the PDF automation solution, we will need to evaluate the accessibility of the output.
	* We should add Twitter Card metadata to the generated pages: https://dev.twitter.com/cards/overview
	* Move relevant content from the ILDH to the Guide site.
		* If me move content from the ILDH, we will have to either point to the guide site, or automatically pull the info from the guide site
		* 

PhET / Discovery Cats
	* TJ played through both, but nothing specific came up

The L3: Lifelong Learning Lab
		* We need to add the type of metrics that TJ uses - bicycle data. Strava
			* https://www.strava.com
				* https://strava.github.io/api/
				* http://labs.strava.com/developers/
			* this probably looks like:
				* ability to indicate you want to track a numeric metric
				* a prompt to track it as part of the daily journal page
				* ability to indicate what the measure used is (kilometres/miles, time spent, etc)
					* automated unit conversion
						* specific measure (km / miles, hours / seconds)
						* type of measure (distance, time)
						* the number itself
				* eventually, ability to connect to other systems/devices to track measurement
				* this underlying capability will form the basis of various other functions for numeric tracking
			* design challenge to show different metrics in the same chart
		* reskin UI based on user prefs

QI
Music Controls
	* TJ can connect us with someone in Srilanka creating OER.

Chart Authoring
	- fix side-by-side duplicate percentages bug
	- maybe a demo that shows multiple chart styles from the same data. so we can show of our charting framework 


Providing teachers with the scaffolding to use open content, local content and individualized content. 

Helping people who have adopted the open texts to now leverage the fact that they are open.



Tidy up tasks: 

- get Learning Dashboard code into a state where it can be moved to the repository
- get the latest chartAuthoring code finally merged
