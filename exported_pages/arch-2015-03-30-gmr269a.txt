PULL REQUEST STATUSESES/STATZ: ¯\(º_o)/¯  <--- much fancy ASCII artz
	* Grunt will run tests: https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/444 - needs reviewer I can review this one (colin)! Thanks colin!
	* Detect running solutions (ProcessReporter) - next steps: https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/355 - will be replaced by a new version targeted towards #425, pending #425
	* Always installed support - https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/407 -- pending #425
	* Solutions creation tutorial: https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/325 -- Steve Githens not present at the meeting - kasper will ping him and potentially take over this JIRA
	* Giant pull: https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/425 - Colin is reviewing the last OS specific parts (expecting to get to that this week). Antranig has work to do, addressing the comments.
	* Windows screen resolution - next steps: https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/280
		* We're able to retreive the available resolutions in linux (and set them)
		* We're uncertain of the status of how to retrieve resolutions in windows
		* We're lacking suppport from the core architecture to use this information (only provided by linux' xrandr module) in order to come with a right value for screen resolution on different displays.
		* ACTION ITEM: Kasper will set up a meeting about this
	* Windows Virtual Magnifier - https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/301 - needs work (see next agenda item)
 
PERMISSIONS FOR SETTINGS IN PROGRAM FILES (WINDOWS)
https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/301

Actions:
	* Kasper will create a JIRA with the issue of writing in Program Files without escalated privileges and bring this to Dipesh, to see if we can get around this issue in a window'ish way
	* Simon to make note of need to run some GPII actions with elevated privileges and the need for a solution for handling
		* examples: system configuration changes that require elevated privileges or installing software
		* an example to look at on Windows would be to see how Mozilla separates and coordinates the Firefox browser (user process) from the Firefox updater (elevated privileges)
