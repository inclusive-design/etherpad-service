UPDATES:
    
Kasparnet:
	* A couple of job interviews for an RtF QA position
	* Updated the infusion docs pull request (left some questions for antwarning)
	* Updated 2*infusion pulls to master
	* Working on inverse transformation one - struggling with datasource not behaving (or well, more likely, me doing the wrong thing)

Adewale
 - Completed Vulnerability assessement functional and technical requirements analysis
	 - Includes evaluation criteria for selecting vulnerbility scanners for code base as well as infrastructure (Containers, kubernetes etc)
	- Criteria includes (Focus Images\Containers, Licenses cost structure, Languages, Community, and Scalability)
- Started a presentation that'll go over NIST, FISMA and FedRAMP requirements for the extended APCP team (user experience, usability, stakeholder teams)

Ale
	* Review, meetings and decisions about installer.
	* Meetings and work plan for Onboarding.
	* Started to look into macOS and pending Windows vagrant machines.

Alfredo
	* Working on continuous integration system: GPII-1822, GPII-1876, GPII-1781

Avtar:
	* Worked on CI tasks as well GPII-1863 and GPII-1822

Joseph
	* Process Reporter, Windows edition (GPII-442/GPII-1826))
		* https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-442
		* https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-1826
	* Attempted running existing unit tests with the current state of the windows proces reporter.
	* Out of the box, 75% of the tests succeeded.
	* Of the remaining, the failures were due to linux-isms.
	* As of today, 39/40 of the tests pass.
	* The last test requires more info from Windows system calls -- still working on that.
	* Side effect -- dividing the unit tests into "universal" vs. OS-specific. 

Michelle 
	* interviewing
	* overall planning
	* QI specific planning
	* task tray

Simon

	* Pushed early version of browser-compatible PouchDB data source work
	* Got great feedback from Tony
	* Meeting with Adewale and Gio about security and spending some time reading up on container scanning solutions
	* Preparation for making a Nexus video for P4A on Friday

TONY

1.     Finished the P4A report due July 10th, just waiting for internal feedback.

2.     Now that I'm free to code again, I'm continuing to work on UL API refactor.  

        This week, updated the search to use the the updated gpii-location-bar library.  UL
        searches will now be fully navigable, and an existing search state can be loaded 
        from bookmarks, plain old links, or the browser history.

3.     Still struggling with browser testing

        For the UL API browser search tests, I now need to test navigation, which we can 
        currently only do with Nightmare/gpii-test-browser. I would really rather only have 
        one browser testing platform per project, and I already have testem/QUnit tests in 
        the package. Thus, I researched options for resolving the impasse.
        
        First, I looked at parsing plain-old QUnit tests from within Nightmare.  Seems 
        possible, but ill advised.  I also revisited navigation and keyboard input in 
        various WebDriver solutions (Nightwatch/Intern/WebDriverIO/WebDriverJS).  If I can find
        one that has good support for parsing the results of QUnit tests, I'll spike an 
        approach.
        
4.     Reviewed first pass at browser-side PouchDB grades that Simon is working on.

5.     Working to integrate the user review work being undertaken at Ilunion with the UL API.
        
        Their code requires tomcat and MySQL to be installed and configured.  Even though 
        the project is not ready to put on the Quality Infrastructure yet, it's easiest to
        take advantage of the new Vagrant + QI system and set up a configured VM using Vagrant.
        
6.     Evaluated the "Accessibility Plugin 2.0" for Confluence.

	   Unfortunately, although it's  an improvement it doesn't meet our needs.  There is a new editor
	   coming, will keep watching that.

Giovanni:
* Implemented mod_security 2.7 with OWASP rules as a Web App Firewall (WAF) for Jenkins
* Static website is gone, https://ci.gpii.net is the live website
* Need to review implementation to use mod_security 2.9 so the Trustwave Commercial Rules we bought can work
* Hoping to get back to Kubernetes so we can start provisioning mini-clusters for developers


Sandra:
	*     Lot of activity with staffing, several interviews scheduled this week (QA specialist and Windows programmer)
	*     Working on survey for IT at job centers
	*     Michelle and I working on capturing information to enable the team to size the features/functions of GPII at first deployment
