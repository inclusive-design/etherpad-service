Agenda Items:

* Agile project planning decisions [tyler]
	* Scrum vs Kanban -> Scrum
	* Iteration length -> 3 weeks
	* Standups -> 3x/week. Sandra will send a doodle
* Want separate space for high-level technical discussion (not clobbered by iteration planning)
	* Maybe keep regulary devops weekly for planning, use APCP Core Weekly for high-level discussion
* Demos: include in Architecture meetings? APCP weekly meetings?

Some loose ends from the mailing list discussions (if we have time to tie them up) [gio]:

	* Ansible tags and how to test them (deploy/configure/test/install)
		* http://lists.inclusivedesign.ca/mailman/private/ops/2017-March/000353.html
		* http://lists.inclusivedesign.ca/mailman/private/ops/2017-March/000364.html
		* If there's no way to test, should we remove them?
		* If they add extra code, should we remove them?

	* Version pinning
		* Idea was proposed but there are unaddressed concerns (and we have started to follow this strategy in new roles)
			* http://lists.inclusivedesign.ca/mailman/private/ops/2017-February/000323.html
			* http://lists.inclusivedesign.ca/mailman/private/ops/2017-March/000345.html
		* How new versions for the following apps will be addressed?
			* CentOS base packages
			* CentOS updates
			* EPEL packages
			* Docker
			* Jenkins
			* InfluxDB
			* nginx
		* Is it acceptable to have optional version pinning?
			* https://github.com/gtirloni/ansible-nginx-common/blob/molecule/defaults/main.yml#L3-L4
			* https://github.com/gtirloni/ansible-nginx-common/blob/molecule/vars/main.yml#L3-L4
			* https://github.com/gtirloni/ansible-nginx-common/blob/molecule/tasks/main.yml#L8-L11
			* How about testing it? molecule doesn't seem able to do that at this point.
			* Is adding extra code acceptable?
		* Latest batch of upgrades also upgraded supposedly pinned packages. How do upgrade system-level packages now?
			* http://lists.inclusivedesign.ca/mailman/private/ops/2017-March/000343.html
		* What existing Ansible roles need fixing (and when)?

	* Ansible Style Guide
		* Is there any interest in this?
		* http://lists.inclusivedesign.ca/mailman/private/ops/2017-March/000346.html
		* http://lists.inclusivedesign.ca/mailman/private/ops/2017-March/000365.html

	* AWS Credentials
		* Per person credentials today have wide permissions
		* IDRC cannot handle extra charges except for the Route53 ones at this point, be careful with any testing using IDRC credentials
		* Should we have R/W and R/O credentials for different services?
