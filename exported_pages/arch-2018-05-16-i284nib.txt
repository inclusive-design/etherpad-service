	* need to update my work on the MockProcessReporter based on the above merges (GPII-2755 [https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2775]).
	* Worked a bit with Tony on .nycrc rules for code coverage (GPII-2493), specifically massaging the exclude-to-include global patterns to include only what we want.
	* Wondered if it might be better to name modules such that names used in platform implementations (linux, windows) never match module names used in universal.  See https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/172#discussion_r188371496
