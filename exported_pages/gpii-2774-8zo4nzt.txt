1. "back" and "forward" buttons:
back: scroll back in time to view previous commits
forward: scroll forward in time to view more recent commits
- The word "Scroll" may not be meaningful. Possibly use a different word like "advance"?

buttons should have "aria-controls" pointing to graphs, (Ideally to the x-axis, since that it what is being scrolled/controlled, but the graph is a good first approximation)
buttons can have aria-describeby points to longer descriptions

other suggestions:
1. replace the back and forward buttons with a scrollbar
2. use tooltips (wrap the descriptions into a tooltip widget)

2. Provide a data table for each graph
Suggestion: 
	* have a toggle button to show the data table visually and both the graph and the data table are screen read accessible
	* Using html <summary>, <details>, the expansion/contraction of the data table would be automated
	* The problem is, with showing such a data table, the whole styling of the page needs to be changed

The first step is to generate the data table then worry about how to present it
