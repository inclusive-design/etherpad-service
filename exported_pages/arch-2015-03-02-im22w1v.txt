JOSEPH:
	* ProcessReporter:
		* Last week:
			* added the ability to query one solution to see if the process is running.
			* - e.g., http://localhost:8081/processes/org.gnome.desktop.orca
			* currently, as part of the payload, the PR returns the platform, i.e., "OS": { "id":"linux", "version":"4.3.4-200.fc22.x86-64" } }. Is that needed?
			* Note:  all work above done in the context of ANTVARNIQUENESS's giant pull request (GPII-1318).
		* This week:
			* Updating to the latest GPII-1318 code in universal
			* Running all the tests, and making sure the PR still works with the latest GPII-1318 code.
	* ARIA
		* still debating Combobox
			* new task:  re-write the definition of aria-activedescendant.
		* and lots of other flotsam.

	* Nexus examples and presentations for the meetings
	* Made pull request to move Nexus development to GPII organization: https://github.com/GPII/nexus/pull/1
	* APCP meetings


TONY:
	* Continuing to get the UL (and eventually the PTD) ready for review.  Started in October 2015, due by June.  The race for quality has no finish line, so technically it's more of a death march. (thanks, demotivators).
	* Currently working through remaining PRs for gpii-express, gpii-binder, gpii-handlebars, gpii-express-user, gpii-json-schema, gpii-pouchdb-lucene.  Only four left open!  Notable things Antranig gently shamed me into doing this week:
		* Finally learning to use "activatable" and "selectable" grades properly.
	* Continuing to pull bits of existing packages into their own micro-modules for wider reuse.  This week we're talking about:
		* a new "asymmetrical" CouchDB dataSource: https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-1253
		* a client-side dataSource that follows the same conventions as the existing Kettle dataSources, but, you know, works on the client side: https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-1587


Client side keyboard events - testing
	* Currently we use jquery.simulate (no longer supported by its maintainers)
	* Nightmare uses a similar strategy, namely triggering events on elements as though they had been sent keyboard input.
	* This makes it difficult to test keyboard navigation, for example.
	* Have been researching things like Intern, which allow using the WebDriver API to control the browser directly.
	* Want to hear what everyone else has done in this area, about new approaches, etc.

Colin:  
Tony seems to be the front-runner in looking into this stuff.. This is not of significant enough importance to him to be able to spend all his time on it, but if someone else needs this or is interested in this, he would like to pair up on examining approaches.
