	* Amarja
		* A1: Languages are installed but not showing up in the QSS - NOT CRITICAL
			* This is because Morphic only support our language packs - although this behavior can be changed with a config flag
			* According to Bern, not likely to use the language feature during the case studies - as the users are already on their pcs GREGG AGREES NOT IMPORTANT
		* A2: Save error for volume button - PR AVAILABLE
			* We must treat the volume as a command - not a setting. There is a PR https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/pull/203 that addresses this
		* A3: Save error for Adjust Mouse - NEEDS WORK - Dont worry about this according to gregg
			* Save error - Last update: https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/pull/206#issuecomment-638800962
			* QS not turning larger mouse pointer on/off (also ASz3): https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-4506, PR is https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/879
		* A4a: When you click on Documorph, more panel also opens/ expands - CAN'T REPRODUCE - also "later" according to gregg
			* Can't reproduce - asked for a pattern (if any)
		* A4b: When you click on My Saved Settings, More panel flashes for few seconds  - CAN'T REPRODUCE - also "later" according to gregg
			* Can't reproduce either
		* A5: Multiple Documorph windows open up - FIXED 
			* This should be fixed now after https://github.com/javihernandez/morphic-documorph-installer/releases/tag/0.2 and https://github.com/javihernandez/gpii-windows-installer/commit/d1d837aa349bbc00bf2e96b6ba6d9a8849d2df46
			* It'll be available in the next installer
		* A6: Volume when changes are not reflected in real time - LATER
	* Maureen
		* M1:  Color Vision/filter error - SCREENING - OK to skip according to gregg
		* 2 things
			* The QS doesn't reflect the right one after reset to std - https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/pull/196
			* The color filter won't turn off on 1909
				* Javi to test on 1909
				* Javi can't reproduce it in 2 different 1909 vms
		* M2 After receiving the Save error notification (reported in A3), further attempts to save settings (contrast, zoom) resulted in the same error. - SIDE EFFECT OF A3
	* Bern
		* B1. Color vision changing to grayscale with settings panel open to “Color Filters” page - BUG-NOT CRITICAL? - later
			* JIRA: https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-4499
		* B2. Note: Avast does a virus/malware check on several components on installation - WON'T FIX? - wont fix according to gregg
		* B3. Not this version! Avast had sequestered tray-button.exe as a threat - NOT A BUG? - agreed from gregg
		* B4. Color Vision menu not reflecting reality - RELATED TO M1
	* Maegan
		* MG1: Unable to Save without Morphic Key after Reset to Standard - NOT A BUG
	* Yao
		* Y1: [metrics] [Must have] Auto-data should report a “preference” event for each setting change from saved preferences. - GPII-4500 - HIGH PRIORITY according to gregg
			* PR: https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/878
		* Y2: [metrics] [Must have] [dependent on Y1] In “preference” events, change “value” (a field with various data types) to “setTo” (strictly string type) GPII-4501 - HIGH PRIORITY according to gregg
	* Anna
		* ASz1: Morphic error appeared just after installation. After restarting the computer Morphie turned green, all is fine now. - NOT A BUG? - that's ok
		* ASz2: I changed contrast from black on brown to regular and brown background remained on some parts of the website. I see the same issue when I change from black on yellow to regular (see below) - WON'T FIX? - not a problem
		* ASz3: My mouse pointer does not get bigger when I turn on Larger mouse pointer - RELATED TO A3
		* ASz4: Screen zoom button description - now we have- Change whole screen to make everything larger/smaller. Works for everything. - ASKED ANNA FOR UPDATES - NOT important according to Gregg
