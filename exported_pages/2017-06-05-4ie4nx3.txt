This Sprint

Alfredo:
	* GPII-2023, GPII-2024
	* Keep tracking of GPII-2090 (blocked)

Tyler:
	* GPII-2443
	* GPII-2412

Gio:
	* GPII-2391
	* GPII-2411 (blocked)

Retrosprective:

	* We have blocker issues: GPII-2411, GPII-2090 and we don't know how to unblock both situations. And we don't know if it's worth to have these tickets in the sprint.
	* Jira reports don't work
	* A good improvement could be to have a block status at the issues to have a good view of the status and progress of the tasks of the sprint
