GSoC 2017 Ideas:
    
    
	* Game to teach keyboard shortcuts
		* http://ss64.com/osx/syntax-keyboard.html
		* https://support.microsoft.com/en-ca/help/12445/windows-keyboard-shortcuts
		* perhaps a tool to teach digital literacty
	* Automate a11y tests for Infusion using gpii-webdriver
		* Some of the groundwork will be in place via https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2205
	* interactive accessible multi-colour palette tool 
		* https://www.dropbox.com/s/6eqqrjlwi7aob8i/Colour%20palettes%20.pdf?dl=0
		* Accessible colour palettes that have more than two colours (most current ones only have two)
		* This could be a useful widget to be able to connect to projects like Chart Authoring ("choose accessible palette")
		* could add colours as desired
		* Export to CSS / Stylus / swatches, etc.
		* Include a contrast mode for monochrome themes
	* AChecker
		* Upgrade AChecker to work with the latest PHP version - http://www.atutor.ca/atutor/mantis/view.php?id=5547
		* Choose a PHP test framework and add a test suite for AChecker
		* A bug fix - http://www.atutor.ca/atutor/mantis/view.php?id=5726 (small one)
	* Video player? does this need work?
		* see "Video Player" section https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Post+Infusion+2.0+Review+Meeting+Notes
	* WCAG Game
		* Learn each principle beyond just accessibiliy - how WCAG can help make for better designs in general.
		* i.e. How the "Understandable" principle is a good design principle, not just for accessibility.
	* Interactive "Flowers and Petals" Inclusive Design tool
		* define petals
		* print off an empty template
		* web-based for collaborations
	* Inclusive design guide adaptations:
		* features to allow adaptations of the Guide for different audiences
		* allow a user to pick and choose cards to adapt or print
		* student can even create an adaptation if there's time.
	* Game to teach about privacy concepts? This could extend from current privacy work and wireframes
	* Responsive program that observes what you are doing on the computer and gives you hints -- digital literacy
		* something related, but smaller scale could be things like the "mini assessments" for sticky keys and etc in the first discovery tool
	* Poetry Map a11y
		* https://torontopoetry.ca/
		* build accessible mapping components for infusion
	* Sonification prototyping tool
		* quickly share, iterate, and collaborate on sonfications of data
	* Something related to Math accessibility?
	* Accessible business way finding tool
		* integrate AXS maps and Google reviews 
		* Sort of like: http://tech.aph.org/ne_info.htm
		* Aggregate accessibility venue data.
	* Expansion of the first discovery tool into a game -- targeted for the Oak project populations
	* Remote co-design tools
		* Multiplexing audio streams (so a remote user can hear another participant's screen reader and mic)
		* Maybe even a list of tools and practices a co-design newbie can follow to use it
		*
