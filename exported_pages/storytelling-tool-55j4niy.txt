CONCRETE STUFF
- in January, Avtar is going to start making us a video for the storytelling tool which we'll be able to use for the P4A review, but will also be useful for SJRK / Floe
- by January...
	- What features do we want the tool to have?
	- What do we want to be able to demonstrate?

Latest build:
    https://build.fluidproject.org/sjrk-storyTelling/

Latest design:

POSSIBILITIES / QUESTIONS
- UIO implementation?
	- Using multilingual UIO
- do we need a deployed version with persistence?
	- Storage of large binary files? (audio, video)
	- Possibly already extant DataSource grade that deals with files that we can extend
- design - visual and interaction? mobile?
- search and display of stories?
- transcribing recorder integration?
- image uploading?
	- designing an infusion component to capture from the camera?
- translation?
- audio input? audio recording? video?
	- yes :)
	- basic editing features?
	- duration restrictions?
	- 3rd-party platforms for hosting?
		- WebRTC
	- what is the experience like on a mobile device?

Why the storytelling tool for a P4A video?
	- other projects that may be more appropriate?
		- The nexus, highlighting the visible nexus

A video about the storytelling tool should be about people telling stories. Either as an implementation of the SJRK projects or as part of our process in developing the tool
Organize a storytelling session with some people, create a "micro-site" that lets people tell their stories and share them (visuals, audio, etc)
	- user testing
	- "what I did when..."
	- STORY JAM - friends and family sort of thing, low-cost and easy to organize - document this? with custom-voice-over with details about components
	- can we have some persistence for this somehow? including a "browse all stories" option
Having a "concrete" implementation of a storytelling site available for people to tell some stories, which we'll be able to point to and build on

- designs for audio and images (audio at same "level" as text entry etc) i.e. multi-modal - Dana work with Eloisa
- further designs for uploading/adding images - Dana
- snazz up the visual design a little - Dana
- create a design narrative? (like MyL3)
- Oak report - find out what Jutta wants for this
	- stories from partners - who they're working with, what are the stakes, what are the communities
-UIO for learning differences - scaffolding for learning disabilities?
- how we think about learning differences (highly contextual, more expansive than "learning disabilities", non-medical model)
	- how this impacts how we think about building scaffolding, tools and research
	
- look at persistence options
	- costs
	- cloud options
	- 3rd-party
