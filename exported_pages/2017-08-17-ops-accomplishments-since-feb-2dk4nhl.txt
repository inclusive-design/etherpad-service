	* ELK cluster for metrics collection and analysis
	* Evaluate container orchestration systems. Decide on Kubernetes
		* The Plan A for the Cloud infrastructure is based on this technology
		* A cloud based on containers is very easy to export to third party providers
	* Numerous improvements to Continuous Integration system
		* A catalog of all the MS Windows flavours (from windows 7 to windows 10 creators update) where the GPII can be tested
		* The catalog can be updated almost automatically
		* Vagrant CI plugin that orchestrates the build of the previous VMs and the tests of the GPII on any host (desktop PC or CI servers)
		* Also the plugin is able to build complex environments that involves multiple VMs to test the GPII against a virtualized GPII cloud
		* Simplification of the Docker containers based on Alpine (lighter and faster)
	* Numerous improvements to GPII to facilitate CI improvements and cloud deployment
		* Every change promoted to the main repositories triggers all the tests, and only when the tests pass the changes are applied.
	* Prototype for automated deployment of GPII in AWS using Terraform and Kops
		* We trend to automatic deployments, abstracting the operator of all the internals of a cloud deployment.
	* Support the developers with the creation and execution of reliable test environments
