Open questions:   
MViP:
Installers 
	Individual computer installer for MVIP for AJCs, Libraries, (and Community College pre work) [BUILD: Need specs from UX for how each install will obtain the unique ID number - and install credentials -- for BULK installs and for IMAGE installs and for Individual (non-technical user) installs MVIP - individual installs. MVIP[12] needs 
	
	
Key-Ins - 
	Morphic authentication [BUILD: Morphic Authentication need specs from UX] 
		MVIP - Morphic email & Password (with anonymous option) - typed into PSP panel (when not keyed in) 

Question: We have seen l/p fields in the QSS. How is this going to interact with the SSO-derived credentials that we are planning to be our primary credential for the CC rollout?
Gregg: l/p itself should be part of the MVIP.

Gregg: At the CC, the l/p will not show up because they will already be keyed in via the SSO

Gregg: "Home keys" are currently MVP2

Gregg: We are still working thorugh the process where we would ask them for username and password.

Current plan is that at the point they hit "Save" in the QSS, they will be walked through a "Terms of use" document, and then get to allocate l/p credentials which will come to be associated with the same cloudSafe.
SSO, USB NFC is currently key-in 
Social media OAuth, l/p are called "authentication schemes" which will cause log-in

After January we will have key-in plus some other mechanism - biometrics, voiceprints etc. These are in "Future" category.


MViP [i2]:
Key-Ins - 
	G-AP authentication <Moved to i2> Windows Log-in, [BUILD: This is critical path, will be significant work package. Need to start consulting with IT to understand the requirements.] 
LogIn with OAuth (social network user accounts such as Facebook and Google and Twitter) [BUILD: Need specs from UX]
