* Maintenance of site servers ("buffer boxes")
  * Package updates (to the AT we need installed)
  * Contacting proposed management interface
    * We're going to need external accessibility
  * Software/security updates to the box
    * Same
  * Antivirus
    * Who pays? Client? Us? WaveAccess?
  * Personnel requirements / ongoing cost
  * Potential liability
    * If we're a source of breach---or the pivot point in a breach, since we'll be communicating with client processes with root and have the ability to force install malware....

* Security Requirements
  * TLS (encryption of data and authentication information in transit, and command integrity checking)
    * Where?
      * Management interface
      * Buffer box to client process
      * Buffer box to upstream (e.g., installer fetching)
    * Certificates
      * Certificate distribution
      * Server naming
    * Ciphersuite specs, etc.
      * Qualys makes a decent checker for this
    * Certificate validation, private key pinning
      * Understand these are things that even dedicated development teams mess up, all the time
  * Authentication to Management Interface
    * Separated users
      * User storage?
      * User management itself
    * 2FA
      * Steve also pointed out that we will need to specify password storage requirements: e.g., SHA512 with a randomly-generated salt
  * Encryption of data at rest
  * Assessment? Who pays? (Was their suggestion)
  * Codesigning
    * Not supported by NuGet, so we're paying them to invent a solution? Needed by NIST
  * Software Supply Chain Transparency
    * I noticed they were seriously worried about this, which concerns me

* Other Issues
  * IP agreement: do we own all the resulting source code?
  * IP agreement: do they indemnify us if it turns out they stole the code? (Copyright/patent issues)
  * Code quality
    * I'm deeply concerned here, since I asked them for details on things in their proposal and they had none
    * I have worked with code from outsourced dev groups before; there is often a huge cost of fixing the software, particularly when security issues are found
    * Proposal as Prologue: it's littered with typos
      * Package providers from package manager PackageManagement can be changed in the future that can affect the functionality of the current solution.
      * Provision of only trusted software packages.
      * Not included to the estimation
      * The most modern project management and execution methodologies are used that allows us
to achieve high quality results and impressive performance.

Outcome:
    1. Provide them with more requirements and potential approaches or methods. (Steve and Brendan)
    2. Asked them to develop a design for which we'll pay. 
    3. Once they deliver it, we can assess whether they have the right set of skills and approach and understanding to implement it.
