			* also learning about debugging with VS Code and GPII
		* Filed a PR for rounding model transformation in Infusion ( https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/837 ) 
	* Need to update infusion in my GPII-2424 branch before i can send a PR for current UIO+ work

	* Finished adding Table of Contents adaptation to UIO+
	* Switched to use the mobile presentation of UIO for the UIO+ panel, so that arrows will indicate additional panels. However, it's fairly minimal so may want to switch back to desktop presentation.

Tony:
	1. Working with the SAI team to get ready for their September user review.  This week, created reports and "curation" scripts to clean up various duplicated and incomplete image data coming from UL vendors.
	1. Spiked the two remaining viable approaches to internationalising (and localising) messages, one with i18next, the other with Infusion's messageResolver. Will write up results for review in the next PCP API meeting. When is that?
	1. Worked on pushing Antranig's "root" fixes through "the stack" of gpii-X packages I maintain.  Also updating to use the newest Vagrant image and confirming everything working without the drive mounting steps I used previously. Also updating deps and other housekeeping (mainly to address snyk feedback).
	1. Finally able to reproduce Windows-specific issues with the gpii-handlebars pull in a BootCamp VM, will work on those tomorrow.
	1. Fixed a timing but in gpii-testem that was resulting in incomplete code coverage reports in the infusion pull I'm working with Cindy on.  Resolved that, should be ready for further review.
	1. Away for three weeks starting on August 5th, if you need my input before September, you still have a week to reach out.
