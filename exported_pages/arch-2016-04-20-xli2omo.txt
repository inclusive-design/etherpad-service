Tony:
    
	1. There are a small handful of breaking changes in gpii-express, get in touch if you are already using it.  The remaining work should not break anything, including the followup work after this is fixed: https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5893
	1. Getting close enough on the gpii-express pull to start pushing the updates through other packages, already finished updating gpii-pouchdb, gpii-pouchdb-lucene, gpii-test-browser and gpii-handlebars
	1. Working through gpii-json-schema issues tomorrow with Antranig, then moving on to gpii-express-user and finally the UL API itself.
	1. Adding precommit lint checks to all my projects has thus far saved me from my own laziness and slopiness at least six times this week.
	1. As part of the ongoing PRs, ran istanbul and improved test coverage based on those reports: https://github.com/gotwarlost/istanbul  It's super easy, and will save your bacon.  I found multiple problems with untested "failure mode" blocks as a result of running istanbul.
	1. Also added Travis CI configuration files and set up my local forks to be tested while I'm working on the branches.  It's super easy, just:
		2. Create an account:  https://travis-ci.org/
		2. Make it aware of your github account.
		2. Tick the button to sync the repo.
		2. Commit a file like  https://github.com/the-t-in-rtf/gpii-express/blob/GPII-1682/.travis.yml
		2. Bathe in the warm glow of your notification mails and dashboard: https://github.com/the-t-in-rtf/gpii-express/blob/GPII-1682/.travis.yml
	1. Have been adding documentation to most code under review.  It's not easy at all, but is worth doing.  Here's an example of the newest format based on our ongoing discussions in various PRs:  https://github.com/the-t-in-rtf/gpii-express/blob/GPII-1682/docs/router.md

OAuth server - availability (for internal use) [HENS]

Open questions:
	* To what extend do we feel ready to deploy the OAuth server?
	* How do we go about credentials provisioning?

From previous meetings:
Got a complaint from a customer that the flowmanager didn't have OAuth support.
We ofc., want to provide a good customer experience and deploy a 'semi-production' OAuth server.

Cindy: It's not ready to be deployed in production mode (ie. open to the public).
Antranig/Simon: we're not currently in production and the preferences server is open for everyone to POST/PUT to. 
Hens: Where should the 'what used to be called the first discovery tool' be located?
Simon: It can live anywhere - but it has to be registered as an application that is authorized. Each instance of the discovery tool should have its own credentials (so they can be revoked).
Hens: So realistically you wouldn't ever run the discovery tool on a local device? 
SIMON: Correct
