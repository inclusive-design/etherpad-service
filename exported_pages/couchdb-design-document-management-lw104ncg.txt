Meeting of 11th September 2017

Present: ADTKINS, Alan, Antranig, Cindy, Colin. Gregor, Simon

Agenda:
	* design document management
	* document management
	* validation of documents
	* migration of documents
	* Capturing CouchDB configurations via Infusion components: https://github.com/waharnum/couch-config/tree/SJRK-6

 ALAN AND GREGOR'S RECENT WORK
	*  couch configuration: https://github.com/waharnum/couch-config
		* a concern in this project: https://github.com/waharnum/sjrk-storyTelling-server
	* regarding Couch specifically, we are most immediately interested in managing views and other "configuration" aspects of the database

SIMON ON MIGRATION AND VALIDATION
	* need is becoming more pressing as we get into managing systems with user data
	* "testable, reproducable" method for migrating a database over time (a la SQL)
	* versioning of views and other configuration aspects of the DB
    
TONY ON JSON SCHEMA
	* may be helpful for validation

What projects do we have coming up that could benefit from this?
	* SJRK storytelling tool project: https://github.com/waharnum/sjrk-storyTelling-server
	* GPII as a whole - http://gpii.net/
	* Other non-GPII projects needing to store and manage data, such as MyL3

Have we/shall we do a technology survey to determine what approaches are current in managing Couchdb design documents in a node module?
Alan thinks there is not much at any useful level of abstraction.
- A standard, minimal client - https://github.com/dscape/nano (official Apache supported)
- https://github.com/flatiron/cradle

Shall we assemble a "bestiary" of what CouchDB views we currently have, and what uses they are put to?
	* I imagine our OAuth work in the core GPII will be a rich source of these
	* 

Use cases for a technical review
	* Design document management
	* Document migration and structure evolution
	* Questions to answer
		* Does a decent, maintained high-level Node library for CouchDB exist that could be wrapped?
			* Something above the level of Nano or other REST-style API libraries
	* urgency
		* Two weeks?
		* Simon: how far are we away from having user data in APCP? November/December time for PCP with memory deployment
