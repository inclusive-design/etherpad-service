	* Create a GitHub repo validator middleware that can be used for commits or contributors requests
	* New component for constructing common response layout -- two properties, one summary, one events

Use kettle dataSource to send a request and receive a response: https://github.com/GPII/first-discovery-server/blob/master/src/js/preferencesRouter.js

Questions:
1. should kettle dataSource(kettle.dataSource.URL) be used to send requests to the remote github for fetching results?
2. If kettle dataSource needs to be used, shall the entire backend use kettle? or the backend uses gpii.express but the handling for sending github requests uses kettle dataSource
