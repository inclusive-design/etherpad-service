We want you to create a simple guess the number type game.

These are the requirements:

The program chooses a random number between 1 and 100, then challenge the player to guess the number (in 10 turns).
After each turn, the player should be told if they are right or wrong â€” and, if they are wrong, whether the guess was too low or too high.
It should also tell the player what numbers they previously guessed.
The game will end once the player guesses correctly, or once they run out of turns.
When the game ends, the player should be given an option to start playing again.

You have 2 hours to complete the exercise.

When you are done with the program, share it with us so we can take a look at it.
We may ask you for some clarifications about your code within the next two days.

Remember:
	* This is not a contest, do your best according to your skills and particular interests.
	* Bear in mind that we aren't looking for a frontend rock star but a backend developer
	* We do know that you can spend years working on this program, so balance between "Must have" vs "Nice to have"
	* We need to be able to get and run the program locally
	* Feel free to add code annotations, comments and/or even making a TODO list with things that you would add to your program for the long run, remember that you only have 2 hours.

To Bryan: Any questions, doubts?
