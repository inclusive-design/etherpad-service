		* http://idrc.ocadu.ca/about-the-idrc/getinvolved
	* How did you get involved
		* word-of-mouth
		* attending community meetings
		* mailing lists
		* hired
	* What we could do better
		* distinction / overlap of our various projects
			* so many links to lots of projects can be overwhelming
			* easier if have a single project to start with
			* fluid wiki doesn't provide enough information
		* could have wiki page that links all the info for GSoC students (e.g. related to development)
		* could use an introductory level tutorial to infusion and etc.
		* lots of web sites, not sure where to look for what
		* not sure what type of contributions are needed for the various projects (e.g. develompent, design, research, etc.)
	* Who is in our community/Who isn't?
	* GSoC Specific
		* having time to code review
		* need wiki gardening for resources that are useful
		* need to have clear language for how to do things, may have language barriers
		* should students use the fluid-work mailing list for introductions or stick to the IRC channel
		* keeping track of CLAs
		* Ask past students to provide feedback on their experience, and to provide information about how they learned to use the various tools and etc.
	* Possible solutionsf
		* Think of Fluid as the umbrella community, and other things like FLOE as projects that are contributed to by it
		* Can have getting involved guides that are specific to the various levels, IDRC, Fluid, etc. and interlink as needed
	* Concrete next steps
		* Getting started page specific to GSoC, expectations.
			* if this is more generic it can be used for interns and other volunteers
		* Looking to Get Involved pages for IDRC, Fluid, etc
		* Wiki gardening
		* Glossary of community specific terminology (e.g. inside jokes, inside knowledge, etc.)
		* Timeline of projects
