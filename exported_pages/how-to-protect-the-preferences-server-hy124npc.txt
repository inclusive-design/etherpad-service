Our current OAuth2 implementation: https://wiki.gpii.net/w/GPII_OAuth_2_Guide

OAuth2 spec: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749

The authorization of the undeveloped PCP
	* Ensuring that Preference Sets can't be written to except by authorized clients (i.e. for now, the as-yet-undeveloped PCP)
		* Could potentially use OAuth2 "Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant" - https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.3


What Applications Read From the Preferences Server?
	* Is the local flow manager the only app that reads using gpii token?
	* Cloud-Based Flow Manager
	* (First Discovery Tool) - this will probbaly be folded into a locally-installed Electron app?
	* PMT
	* Other preferences editors, either running on a web server somewhere or locally installed, that have been reviewed and vetted by THE GPII
	* A third-party, non-locally integrated Web Appication (e.g. BrowseAloud or UIO or something integrated into some website)

Three types of preferences clients:
	* CBFM
	* Editor
		* Local (in electron)
		* Web
	* Directly-Integrated Web Applications (i.e. that connect to the CBFM, not the local one)

We THINK the only differences between a "locally-integrated web application" and "directly-integrated web application" are:
	* the direct application knows the GPII token
	* the direct application contacts the CBFM directly, rather than relying on an API that is available in JavaScript (injected by the GPII extension)
	* the direct application must use the OAuth 2 Authorization Code flow to receive an OAuth2 Access Token and the user must:
		* provide a user name and password for authentication
		* authorize the direct application

PICTURES
	* Local FM <> CBFM
	* Locally-integrated web applications <> LFM
	* Directly integrated web applications <> CBFM

Protecting the Preferences Server
	* Ensure that only the above-listed three types of preferences clients can read settings from the CBFM

How do we authenticate a local flow manager with the cloud based flow manager?
	* Per installation secret (or private/public key pair)?
		* Will require infrastructure to provision and revoke installations
