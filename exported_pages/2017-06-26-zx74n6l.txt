Notes:
    Sprint 4:
        - Alfredo: 2023 and 2024 were completed. List of metrics seems to be changing, Alfredo needs the updates (2390).
        - Tyler: Completed 2443. Moving 2412 back to the backlog.
        - Gio: Completed GPII-2391. GPII-2411 back to the backlog. 
Restrospective: Too optimistic. Make 8 story points the upper limit per sprint? Need more specification about the metrics. Need to remember to include vacation or other known blocking items. 
            
Sprint 5 Planning:
    
    Gio: GPII-2391 Continuation 
	    GPII-2464 - For sure
	    GPII-2463 - high priority if need to store a state (Gio will confirm with Cindy/Simon)
	    GPII-2465 - Lowest. Tyler would not work on this at this time. 
	    GPII-2470 - End-to-end tests
    Alfredo: 
        Continue working on Metrics. GPII-2390
    Tyler: 
        GPII-2412 - Continue working on this. Need to determine what is the next thing to pick up. 

Regarding question about security, what preferences need to be stored, etc. Gio will talk to Cindy tomorrow. 
Sandra will investigate how to keep completed tasks in the sprint scrum board.
