Things We're Stuck On
	* CI-related race condition in FLUID-6300
	* 


Things Need to Figure Out
	* Are we already using partials-within-partials?
	* Why is SJRK-61 still in the backlog? Is it fixed or is there more work to be done?


A Path Forward
	1. Crush as many easy wins as possible, fast 
		2. Spike until November 30
	1. Prioritize test coverage
		2. Sprint December 3-14 
		2. Goal: as much test coverage improvement as possible within the spring timeframe
	1. Short research spike on video uploading and capture
		2. Spike December 17-21
	1. Coordinate with Justin, Cindy, Antranig to solve the bigger UI Options-related JIRAs

Multilingual UIO
	1. Can UIO be localized statically (i.e. provided with a set of languages bundles etc. that fully translate its UI)?
		* Yes, but it has to be statically configured (e.g. provided with language bundles for your site's default (i.e. only) language
			* There may be some parts that aren't localizable or are not easily done.
	1. Will it respond to the user agent's specified language?
		* No
	1. Can it support dynamic locale switching?
		* Either by a site's own language change widget or via an enactor provided within UIO
		* No (until FLUID-6300 is done)

Three Things to Do
	1. Have a conversation and make some estimates regarding the UIO work in the Storytelling Tool (Justin and Gregor)
		2. Do any of the "easy wins" or high priority tasks to UIO as needed
	1. Create a "community governance a la carte" document in the wiki
		2. Then move the Storytelling Tool into the fluid-project org based on the above
	1. Implement audio and video storytelling without compromising our existing state of test coverage if possible
		2. Organize any existing Jiras into a list of tasks, prioritized, required to achieve this
