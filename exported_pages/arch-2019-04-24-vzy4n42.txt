Tony

	1. Started spiking Infusion docs search using Fuse.js.  Finished the back end work, now "just" have to build a UI.  The approach seems promising, the full set of docs and tutorials typically takes less than 1ms to index and less than 50ms to search.
	1. Submitted two pulls to update CI.  Now working on the first one (for Infusion) with Alan.

Tyler:
* GCR/version-updater improvements. Dev workflow is shipping today-ish. Shortly is good.
* Upgrading images, including couchdb (thanks Tony for confirmation on versions). Shipping this week-ish.

AGENDA:
    
- Given the status of the pilots and whatnot, are we still holding back on merging major items into universal/windows/gpii-app, or can that resume now?
* https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3221

Here's javi's branch he's been using for the latest releases: https://github.com/javihernandez/gpii-app/tree/GPII-3806.loginSolution

- New features requires collapsing lifecycle actions of different solutions. TaskBar and TrayIcon needs to restart Windows Explorer, same as Language feature. This action should be done at most one.

Decision: Tony scheduled a meeting to discuss how Steve's work can be merged and deployed
