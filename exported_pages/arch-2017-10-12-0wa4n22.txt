ARCHITECTURE MEETING MINUTES, 10 OCTOBER, 2017

Kasparnet:
	* Back after vacation
	* My computer died on monday, and my flight home was drawn out with an overnight stay in paris due to delays, so I've only now slowly catching up on everything
	* Will focus on PCP requirements and upcoming matchmaker work specout
	* XPS13 vs Lenovo X1C - thoughts?
		* I have the XPS15 and very good components but I think that the Lenovo is better. cool, cheers alfredo
		* Become North American and buy a Macbook :)haha -- already had mac... I've been trying hard to get away from it... why? Well, for one, they last a couple of years and then die...my 2013 MBP says hi :) I've been having the air... so that might be why they're less sturdy ... I must admit I know a lot of people with very old MPBs (MacPookBro?) that run well still.... And secondly, they're evil.. can't argue this one really ;) So I was almost excited that my macbook died... I would like to add a "third" and say something about the price.. but I'm not sure that'll hold up if I get either of the XPS13 or X1C :) this is why you must become North American first :p haha, indeed... I just checked the lenovo website... the price is literally HALF in the US #ThanksObama
		* Which OS? linux - probably Arch, great option. I don't know about the lenovo, but probably I will go for it. ok - cheers
		* Just saw the price, and for the same price you can get the double of memory and screen resolution with the XPS13

Tony:
	1. Working to synchronise the UL API with the SAI as reviewers update and cull existing records.  Once I figured out the docker.for.mac.localhost "feature", made good use of the docker CouchDB 2.0 image in replicating the live data and testing various update scripts.
	1. Speaking of which, the main blocker in the stack in updating to CouchDB 2.0 is this sorting bug/feature with couchdb-lucene:   https://github.com/rnewson/couchdb-lucene/issues/248  Will keep track and push forward as the issue is fixed or a workaround is available. 
	1. Released gpii-json-schema 1.0.3, which adds improved "schema link" handling.
	1. Working on various pulls, including the code coverage pulls for infusion, windows, and linux.
