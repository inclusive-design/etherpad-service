	* Another (and the last) short week for a while.  School's... in... for... summer!  School's... in... for... ever!
	* Prepped for and had a very productive PCP API meeting.  I think we're one solid meeting from having some really clear direction.  Next meeting is next week.

	* Worked with Avtar to test Github / docker / Gitlabs integration (it's what'll hopefully give us build feedback on our PRs going forward).
	* Started trying out npm 5.  It works better than yarn, at least from what I've seen so far. (no problems with sharp, leveldown)
