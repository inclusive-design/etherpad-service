Backlog Grøøming Meeting April 22, 2020

The Kasparnet is scheming to do a pull request focused hackathon next week to get as much of our pull request in the code as possible in a short period of time.

There are two problems we need to solve:
	* Currently a bottleneck for the pulls are Antranig and Grundell (reviewing and owning pulls, respectively)
	* There are issues in the code causing CI to fail

Overboarding:
	* Antranig: We are currently blocked by https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-4462 - this links to a spreadsheet compiling results of CI runs. The narrator autostart setting has failed 7 times out of 24, and needs to be pruned.
AB has filed universal pull https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/866 in order to overboard these settings
	* Hatkins: Has overboarded screen mirroring because it caused serious stability issues, see https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/860/commits/58650030ebc8430455ffff50b1644b012a1196dd
	* Hatkins: Has created an epic to get rid of problematic settings

Action Items:
	1. Javi will merge in Antranig's pull
	1. Antranig will re-update windows to ensure that the issue has gone away
	1. Kasper will make a pull request of Tony's overboarding of screen mirroring against current master (only the relevant win32 portion of  https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/860/commits/58650030ebc8430455ffff50b1644b012a1196dd)
	1. Javi will review Kasper's pull
	1. Tony will update his pull request with the changes in upstream master
